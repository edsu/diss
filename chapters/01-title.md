# Abstract

The web is a site of constant breakdown in the form of broken links, failed
business models, unsustainable infrastructure, obsolescence and general neglect.
Some estimate that about a quarter of all links break every 7 years, and even
within highly curated regions of the web, such as scholarly publishing, rates of
link rot can be as high as 50%. Over the past twenty years web archiving
projects at cultural heritage organizations have worked to stem this tide of
loss. However, we still understand quite little about the diversity of actors
involved in web archiving, and how content is selected for web archives. This is
due in large part to how web archiving projects operate out of sight as complex
sociotechnical assemblages at the boundaries between human and automated
processes.

This dissertation explores appraisal practices in web archives from the
perspective of Science and Technology Studies in order to answer two motivating
research questions. 1) How is appraisal currently being enacted in web archives?
2) How do definitions of what constitutes a web archive relate to the practice
of appraisal? Answering these questions will help better understand the dynamics
that shape our memory of the past that is mediated by the web, and inform
pedagogy in archival studies. Critical Algorithm and Data Studies provide a
theoretical framework for examining how web archiving systems function as both
computational and cultural objects that participate in a wide variety of social
and political projects. As machine learners increasingly become readers of web
archives the stakes for understanding the dynamics by which these collections
are built could not be higher.

Interviews with web archives practitioners, and a year long field study at a
government agency involved in archiving data from the web, will provide rich
descriptive material for an ethnographic analysis of what current practices are,
and how these practices are shaped by the ontological dimensions of web
archives. Critical Discourse Analysis will be used to analyze interview
transcripts and field notes from participant observation in meetings and in the
work of the archive. In addition, methods drawn from Trace Ethnography will be
used to analyze version control histories, and ticketing systems that have been
used to coordinate and assemble a web archive that challenges our notions of
what constitutes a web archive.
