## Abstract

This paper explores the art and science of deciding what web archives collect by
reviewing the literature of archival appraisal through the theoretical lens of
Science and Technology Studies. I suggest that our anxieties around what web
archives remember and forget, get embodied in dreams (and nightmares) of *Big
Data* and *The Cloud*. These notions are best understood by attending to the
specific material practices of people working with memory and machines. The
disciplinary perspective of *software studies* can provide insight into how
these material practices of appraisal operate in response to, and outside of
traditional conceptions of the archive, and also as an instrument of
*governmentality*.
