## II. Appraisal

Generally speaking the field of archival studies is praxis oriented, in that it engages with issues of theory in the context of practice. The specific literature of archival appraisal is a prime example of this praxis orientation. The problem of appraisal is fundamentally concerned with the practical problem of how to select material for an archive given 1) an abundance of records, and 2) a limited amount of space and economic resources to store all of them. @Cox:1988 consider appraisal to be the "first responsibility" of the archivist, and define it broadly as:

> ... any selection activity that enables archivists to identify recorded
> information that has enduring value, primarily for the documentation of
> modern society (p. 29)

In a recent review of the appraisal literature @Anderson:2011 (p. 26) distinguishes between *appraisal* and *selection*, in order to provide clarity about when records are evaluated (appraisal) versus when they are chosen (selected), and when these activities take place relative to an archive taking custody of the records (accession). However for the purposes of this paper a more expansive, and generalist, view on appraisal is taken, which admits that appraisal is a process by which values are asserted about the records. These assertions happen in multiple intersecting timelines and at varying scales that take their shape due to repeated, atomic actions of selection. This more general view will be important later when appraisal activities are considered in light of the sociomaterial dimensions of the web.

While archives have existed for millenia [@Posner:1972], it is only over the past several hundred years that archivists have developed the concept of appraisal in order to manage the ever increasing deluge of records, that has been brought upon them, largely by the technologies of record production. Three years before the web was first prototyped by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, @Young:1985 at the Bentley Historical Library reviewed the literature of archival appraisal in the United States and found 178 monographs, articles, reports and unpublished manuals. A search in 2018 for *appraisal* after 1985 in Library and Information Science Source yields some 300 more. A complete and exhaustive survey of this literature while possibly beneficial, does not serve my purpose here, which is to connect the literature of archival appraisal with practices of web archiving. To do this it is useful to examine meta-theories, or conceptual frameworks that have been used to talk about archival appraisal.

### Archival Meta-theories

@Eastwood:2002 outlines three strains of thinking about appraisal that have developed over the past few centuries of archival studies. The first and most commonly held view, is that appraisal is a vehicle for history: we must choose what to remember from the perspective of the future historian who is attempting to understand today [@Schellenberg:1956]. The second view is that appraisal (the shaping of the archival record by archivists) is not a task for the archivist because it is the enemy of authenticity, evidence and the ultimately the archive itself [@Jenkinson:1922; @Duranti:1994]. And the third is that appraisal is an inherently political act, that necessarily carries with it the threat of erasure, while also providing opportunities for social justice, ethical engagement, and as sites for creative record creation [@Harris:2002 ; @Punzalan:2016].

Eastwood's characterization of appraisal holds up well today, since it casts the three strands not as an evolution in time, but as a bricolage of approaches that coexist and function simultaneously. However it is important to note that Eastwood discusses these three strands of appraisal against a backdrop of Western democratic societies. Eastwood's thesis is that appraisal practices and theories are put to work in the service of democracy, and are to be understood ultimately as a tool for governance and accountability. This is a theme that I will return too shortly. But before I do that I want to examine another appraisal meta-theory.

In her recent study of appraisal practices @Foscarini:2017 draws on the work of @Cook:2013 to describe the discursive tensions that exist in the research literature about archival appraisal. Cook identified a general timeline of archival paradigms:

> I want to suggest that since the later nineteenth century, archival 
> identity has shifted, or has been in the process of shifting, through 
> four such paradigms or frameworks or mindsets, as it has struggled, and 
> still struggles, with this memory-evidence tension. I am calling the 
> four frameworks: evidence, memory, identity, and community. It is 
> important to emphasize that these four accumulate across time; they 
> do not entirely replace each other.

Foscarini takes up these four paradigms to examine how they manifest in different theoretical approaches to appraisal, which largely orient around what can be seen as top-down and bottom-up approaches. In top-down approaches (evidence and memory) the archivist intervenes as little as possible in the service of authenticity and integrity [@Jenkinson:1922], or they analyze organizational hierarchies, structures and activities in an attempt to document society as a whole [@Cook:2004a]. In the bottom-up approach (identity and community) appraisal is recognized as a creative activity, in which history, memory and social relations are assembled as part of a complex set of activities that are not necessarily centered on an institutional context. Foscarini goes on to note that these ideas about appraisal are not steps along a timeline, but are all still very much with us. For example, much of the last few decades of work in digital preservation have been focused on the design and development of technologies for ensuring authenticity and integrity of data, with the implicit and governing assumption that technology can, or should, allow us to perfectly collect everything.

In this paper I am offering my own meta-theory of appraisal specifically for web archives, which relies on Foucault's idea of governmentality as a framework for understanding the full scope of appraisal theories, in their social and historical contexts [@Foucault:1991]. So before diving into these details it is important to first take a look at *governmentality*, which we will return to later as an example of a practice orientation to web archives.

### Govermentality

The records from our earliest archives happen to be coterminous with the beginnings of recorded human history. This is no coincidence given that the methods of history depend in large part on the evidence of the past that survives, and this evidence is often found in archival repositories of various kinds. As such, archives are often seen as historiographical instruments. The disciplines of history and archival studies are twinned, but their relations are somewhat antagonistic. Historians are one of the most active users of archives. The records collected in archives are used by historians as evidence of previous events and activities, which are essential for piecing together and anchoring historical narratives in fact, or as close as can be got to fact many years later. Until the professionalization of archival studies, it was common for archivists to be trained historians, with invested knowledge of the events, people and organizations that the archive is ostensibly concerned with. Who better to tend to the records of an organization than the scholar who knows its history? It wasn't until archivists began to meaningfully grapple with the concept of *appraisal* that an understanding of the archive developed that was more than simply the tool of memory and history [@Taylor:1984], but also as an political and economic instrument of power, accountability, resistance and liberation [@Jimerson:2009].

The archival practices of southern Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, which archival studies points to for its origin story (at least in Western traditions), are examples from the earliest known states used archives to manage records of laws, administrative activities, financial transactions, land ownership, and taxation [@Posner:1972 ; @OToole:2004]. These archives reflected the interests of the earliest states in governing and controlling their populations. Similarly the gaps in records, and their silences, work to demarcate those on the periphery of the state, or outside it altogether [@Scott:2017]. A significant portion of the stories of archives are thus bound up with the interests of institutions, states, governance and what @Foucault:1991 calls *governmentality*.

For Foucault governmentality is a mode of rationality of governing through technologies of power, that reproduce themselves through specific practices. Governmentality is not simply the story of the operations of the state, but is concerned with "the conduct of conduct", and can be found in the practices of individuals, households, families and communities. Foucault traces the emergence of the art of government and political economy, and situates it with the decline of the sovereign, the birth of the modern state, and more recently, neo-liberalism. Governmentality is a useful instrument because it provides a continuous field that includes many modes of archival production and appraisal. It provides a frame for looking at appraisal landscapes as a form of knowledge (savoir), that has particular rules of formation, transformation and correlation with other practices. As noted by @Schwartz:2002:

> Archives have always been about power, whether it is the power of the state, 
> the church, the corporation, the family, the public, or the individual. 
> Archives have the power to privilege and to marginalize. They can be a tool
> of hegemony; they can be a tool of resistance. They both reflect and 
> constitute power relations. They are a product of society's need for
> information, and the abundance and circulation of documents reflects the
> importance placed on information in society. They are the basis for and
> validation of the stories we tell ourselves, the story-telling narratives 
> that give cohesion and meaning to individuals, groups and societies.
> (p. 13)

Foucault's idea of governmentality is useful to keep in mind while tracing practices of archival appraisal, or the practices of deciding what to remember and forget, because of the insights it brings into how appraisal practices function and get encoded into the sociotechnical assemblages of archives and their manifestations in the web. But before turning to look at web archives I want to briefly outline a genealogy of appraisal practices that foregrounds governmentality.

### Tacit Appraisal

Despite the millennial historical arc of archival practice, Western archival studies often locates its theoretical origins in the concept of *respect des fonds*, or more commonly, *provenance* from 19th century France. Respect des fonds is a practice of grouping records by their creator, rather than by subject matter or some other predetermined taxonomy. In practice this means records are grouped together by the organization, family, or individual that created them. As @Bailey:2013a describes, the introduction of provenance occurred in the aftermath of the French Revolution, which saw the simultaneous destruction and reconstruction of records; a truly monumental attempt to both erase and refashion the historical record in the newly established Archives Nationales. While attempting to deal with this project the librarian, archivist and historian Natalis de Wailly introduced the idea of *respect des fonds* in 1841 as a simplified practice for arranging the records:

> The principle was, in fact, a practical exigency, a method to 
> simplify archival arrangement seen as more easily implemented
> by novice archivists than the more rigorous arrangement by 
> classification. @Bailey:2013a

It is significant to note that this use of provenance as a heuristic for organizing records was born amidst what was effectively a massive appraisal process, in which overtly political interests determined the preservation of pre and post-revolution records. However, the concept of appraisal was not itself explicitly part of the expression of respect des fonds. The question of what to keep and what to discard was subsumed into a practice for processing the pre-revolutionary materials.

Despite its partial application in France, respect des fonds proved popular as it spread to Belgium and the Netherlands, where it became part of the *Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives* [@Muller:1940], that was originally published in 1898. The so called *Dutch Manual* added to to the concept of respect des fonds an additional principle named *original order*, which stated that the arrangement of records should be the same as the original organization. In their manual the authors Muller, Feith and Fruin describe how records are created during the activities of administrative bodies or officials that operate using the metaphor of a life-form:

> ... an archival collection is an organic whole, a living organism 
> which grows, takes shape, and undergoes changes in accordance with 
> fixed rules. If the functions of the body change, the nature of the 
> archival collection changes likewise. The rules which govern the 
> composition, the arrangement and the formation of an archival 
> collection, therefore, cannot be fixed by the archivist in advance; 
> he can only study the organism and ascertain the rules under which 
> it was formed. (p. 19)

Even here the idea of appraisal, or the decision of what to keep and what to discard, is tacit. The concept of original order works to prevent the reordering or disruption of records that have *already* arrived as *archival*. The decision of what administrative bodies and officials to collect has already been made, and the principle of original order works to govern how the records are to be arranged and described once they arrive. The surprisingly fresh conception of records as both product and part of a form of life (organicity), still works to bracket off appraisal as something that has already happened out of band. The fact that an administrative body is generating the records is enough to transmute the documents from mere papers into *archival records* that are to be preserved for the long term. The process of governance is at work in the very conception of how the archive functions.

### Realizing Appraisal

In the early 20th century, Hillary Jenkinson imported the concept of respect des fonds from continental Europe and fused it with existing English archival practices in his influential *Manual of Archival Administration*. Jenkinson was a medievalist by training, and stressed the importance of impartiality, authenticity and naturalness (similar to organicity) in archival practice. These three principles coordinate to position the archivist as the *keeper* of records, and proscribes the archivist from acting in any way to shape was is made archival. While Jenkinson admits that decisions need to be made about what to keep, these decisions are made by the record creator, before the records are added to an archive, and not by the archivist after the fact. More recently @Duranti:1994 connects ideas around authenticity to the theory of *diplomatics*, the critical and forensic analysis of documents, which she traces back to the practice of Roman law in the 11th century. Notice here that the locus of appraisal is still in the hands of officials working within administrative bodies, in the bureaucracies of power.

@Tschan:2002 suggests that much of the last century of archival thinking can be characterized as a sustained conversation between Jenkinson's Manual on the one hand, where archival appraisal is verboten and authenticity is paramount, and another manual *Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques* written by historian and archivist Theodore Schellenberg. Schellenberg's manual was written after World War Two, in a moment when record production was vastly outstripping the ability to store them. In his position at the US National Archives and Records Administration, Schellenberg recognized that pragmatic decisions needed to be made about what records to make *archival*, and that those decisions were essentially assertions about value, of which there were two kinds: primary and secondary.

Primary value was the value of the records to the record creator, in their active use. Secondary value on the other hand divided into two subtypes: *evidential* and *informational*. On the surface *evidential value* seems to be quite similar in principle to Jenkinson's interest in impartiality, authenticity and naturalness. However Schellberg makes clear that he is not concerned with the fidelity of the records as evidence, but with how well the records function as evidence of the organization and function of a particular government body:

> By evidential value I do not refer here to the value that 
> inheres in public records because of the merit of the 
> evidence they contain. I do not refer, in a Jenkinsonian sense,
> to the sanctity of the evidence in archives that is derived
> from "unbroken custody." I refer rather, and quite arbitrarily, 
> to a value that depends on the importance of the matter
> evidenced, i.e. the organization and functioning of the 
> agency that produced the records.

Schellenberg outlined a variety of criteria to use for assessing the evidentiary value of records, which crucially links the volume of records with  organizational hierarchy:

![Personnel Distribution United States Civil Service Commission, p. 143](images/schellenberg1.png)

In contrast, *information value* is determined by the archivist in a subjective way, that takes into account the historical moment that the records were created in, and often involves outside consultation with relevant subject matter specialists. Schellenberg, himself trained as a historian, notes that many archivists themselves are historians and thus are "competent to ascertain the historical values of public records" [@Schellenberg:1956 p. 150]. As opposed to a highly structured approach, Schellenberg stressed that determinations of *informational value* by archivists resist consistency and systematization. As a result measures of *informational value* will be different in different contexts, and that "diverse judgments may well assure a more adequate social documentation". 

Even with these allowances for contextual variation, Schellenberg's notions of evidential and informational are significantly framed by the institutional and governmental context. This is plainly seen in his use of the hierarchy of government as a mode of selection in Figure 1. In addition, judgments about historical significance made by archivists and other subject specialists, are key to establishing information value, but are themselves bound up and subject to less visible professional structures of power, which are left largely unexamined. Into this gap we see the final stage in top-down approaches, as the unit of analysis moves from the level of the state up yet further to that of society at large.

### Documenting Society

The archival theorist Terry Cook was an eloquent archival theorist, most remembered for his ability to synthesize archival theory, and mobilize it for work in the present, particularly in the service of appraisal. His theory of *macroappraisal* provides a framework for shifting focus away from the value of records, and towards the values inherent in the functional context that records are created in [@Cook:2005a]. When using macroappraisal archivists study the functions and structures of government and organizations, while specifically attending to the effects that these institutions have on their citizenry and in aggregate, society as a whole. 

> Macroappraisal is thus a provenance-based approach to appraisal, where 
> the social context of the record’s creation and contemporary use (not 
> its anticipated research use) establishes its relative value. (p. 128)

Cooks' articulation of macroappraisal was born in the aftermath of Canada's Deschênes Commission on Nazi War Criminals, which uncovered how a large number of immigration records were inadvertently destroyed by the Canadian National Archives. The controversy sensitized Cook to the abject failure of Schellenberg's concept of *informational value*, or the historical determination of record value. It led him to instead focus attention on present value, instead of future anticipated use, and to anchor that value on a determination of how citizens were impacted by an organization's activities. Cook drew heavily on German archival theorist @Booms:1987, who argued against state controlled appraisal, under repressive Soviet-style communism, and advocated for a view of archival appraisal that measured the interests of society as a whole:

> In our view, a legitimate value standard or principle for the 
> archival appraisal process can only be derived from this kind of 
> contemporary valuation. Such a standard is inherent in history itself, 
> for it is a standard of the past. It is not the product of speculation 
> or ideological beliefs; it does not do violence to source material 
> by applying value standards of the present which in the near future 
> may already prove to be inadequate. If there is indeed anything or 
> anyone qualified to lend legitimacy to archival appraisal, it is 
> society itself, and the public opinions it expresses-
> assuming, of course, that these are allowed to develop freely. (p. 104)

Here we come full circle with the idea of archival appraisal as reflective of the goals of democratic societies as discussed earlier [@Eastwood:2002]. Even with its focus on the state, its citizenry and society as a whole, macroappraisal foregrounds a particular governance structure that supports the needs of a democracy and even (in the case of Booms) notions of social opinion and the marketplace of ideas. While fully aware of the political role that appraisal takes in shaping memory, Cook understands appraisal as a tuning of the machinery of the state, to bring it in line with the interests and well being of its citizenry.

Booms' emphasis on the importance of public opinion is certainly understandable, and even laudable, when faced with state sanctioned repression, violence and media censorship. However an unquestioned reliance on a market for determining public opinion, without a critical engagement with the systems that generate those markets is problematic. Foucault's concept of governmentality is useful for unpacking and factoring these social and market forces, to see them  not only at work in the functions of government, but also in the distributed material practices of individuals, and communities. Understanding how to measure popular opinion, or the impact of records on people, and some approaches that archives have taken to a form of appraisal that speaks directly to it political agency is where we turn next.

### Appraisal Critique

In contrast to governance based approaches to archival appraisal are a group of divergent theories that speak directly to, and work to counter, the obscured, and often erased, influence and effects of power in archives. As we saw previously, structural approaches to appraisal often define appraisal implicitly by outlining principles of original order and provenance that map to an institutional or societal context. In emphasizing the central role of provenance in structuring the archive, certain assumptions are made about what records get to count as archival, who creates them, and what resources are required to mobilize them as an archive. Another group of appraisal practices in archives speak to the archive as a site for record *creation*, not simply preservation. Archival records are part of a larger landscape of memory in which archival records circulate. These bottom up style approaches to appraisal archivists fully engage, and take political responsibility for, their role as shapers of the archival record, and the limits that their actions impose.

In a memorable, and oft quoted, address to the Society of American Archivists in 1974, @Ham:1975 issued a wakeup call for archivists and their practice of appraisal:

> Our most important and intellectually demanding task as archivists is to 
> make an informed selection of information that will provide the future with 
> a representative record of human experience in our time. But why must we 
> do it so badly? Is there any other field of information gathering that 
> has such a broad mandate with a selection process so random, so 
> fragmented, so uncoordinated, and even so often accidental? (p. 5)

Ham highlighted the lack of theorization around appraisal in order to make a plea for increased cooperation, empirical analysis, funding, and intellectual openness for archival appraisal. In many ways Ham was echoing a similar call by historian Howard Zinn, who addressed the same body a few years earlier saying that the archivist had a responsibility to document the lives of ordinary citizens and political movements, to hold power accountable through transparency, and to consciously work against the status quo in archives where

> ... the existence, preservation, and availability of archives, 
> documents, records in our society are very much determined by 
> the distribution of wealth and power. That is, the most powerful, 
> the richest elements in society have the greatest capacity to find 
> documents, preserve them, and decide what is or is not available 
> to the public. This means government, business, and the military 
> are dominant.

Zinn's insights here continue to reverberate in archival studies especially when considering the process of appraisal. He foregrounds the hegemonic shape of archives, and challenges the archival community to not only hold the disciplinary form of the archive accountable, but also to move archival work outside of its governmental enclosure. In many ways this recognition of the role of power in shaping archives marks the birth of appraisal theory. It is in the moment when one can see the dominant mold of archives and its historical form that it becomes possible to talk about how that power has manifested in the records that have been collected and cared for in an archive [@Jimerson:2009]. Foucault's exploration of the role of governmentality is instructive here because he lets us see how power works through the state, but also through disciplinary forms such as the family, the school, the factory, and the prison.

### Strategy

Documentation Strategies is an appraisal technique developed by Helen Samuels as she worked to document university life at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology. For Samuels the archivist works as an analyst in a *distributed network* to study the social forces that generate records, rather than the records themselves. Samuels articulated four parts to developing a documentation strategy: 1) choosing a topic to be documented, 2) selecting the site for the strategy 3) examining the form and substance available documentation, 4) selecting and placing the documentation. This general strategy-for-developing-strategies, or meta-strategy, was distilled down to an appraisal technique known as Institutional Functional Analysis which bears some resemblance to Cook's macroappraiasl, particularly in its attention the functions and societal impacts of institutions.

However, Samuels' crucial insight was that a *network* of analysts and repositories would be needed to address the challenge. A documentation strategy was not concerned with the decisions of a single archivist working within the hierarchical structure of a single institution. This networked approach mirrors Samuels' interest in emerging practices around the use of automated computer networks such as OCLC, RLG and at the distribution of machine readable cataloging data at Library of Congress [@Samuels:1986]. A key aspect to Documentation Strategies is deciding where records are to be held, which may or may not be at the archivists own institution.

Significantly, Samuels also recognized that a documentation strategy may identify gaps in the documentary record, and could in fact suggest the *creation* of records where none currently exist. 

> While archivists acknowledge the overabundance of information, they 
> also recognize that modern communication patterns and records-keeping 
> practices leave gaps in the documentary record. Documentation strategies, 
> however, are ongoing activities and provide the opportunity to intervene 
> in the records creation process and assure the creation and retention 
> of required information. [@Samuels:1986 p121-122]

Seeing archival appraisal as an intervention and as a potentially creative act was a surprisingly radical move, especially given the vast number of records already in need of preservation, and the anxiety about preserving them.

### Decentralization

This shift in attention outside the walls of the physical archive suggested by  Documentation Strategies was in fact part of a longer movement in archival studies that often gets labeled *postcustodial*. The term postcustodial was first used by @Ham:1984 in drawing attention to the ways in which information technology and automation were dramatically transforming the landscape of record production, and the concomitant need for the archival studies field to invest in researching these new forms of record production, in order to adequately preserve and provide access to them. A decade later @Cook:1993 synthesized a significant body of work by @Taylor:1988, @Bearman:1989, @Hedstrom:1991 under the rubric of *postcustodial*, which he aligned with post-modern theories of archives. For these postcustodialists a transformation of archival theory, and especially appraisal, was absolutely necessary because of the proliferation of electronic media, which resist the idea of a singular documentary artifact.

> In this fluid electronic environment, the idea of a record 
> physically belonging in one place or even in one system is crumbling 
> before new conceptual paradigms, where "creatorship" is a more fluid 
> process of manipulating information from many sources in a myriad of
> ways, or applications, rather than something leading to a static, fixed,

> an understanding of the conceptual or virtual interrelationships between

> activities, the information systems, and the resulting records. 
> [@Cook:1993, p.424]

Postcustodial thinkers emphasize that appraisal is not simply a valuation of records during record acquisition, but is inherent in the design and construction of information systems: "archivists need to reexamine how information systems support organizational functions and relate to organizational structure within specific organizations and in a broader documentary context" [@Hedstrom:1991, p. 344]. Postcustodial archival theory crystallized in the Records Continuum model, which dismantles the idea of a linear life cycle for records in which the archive is the place where records come to rest. The Records Continuum instead stresses how archival records are part of multiple, recursive, processual flows, as they cycle between creation, capture, organization and pluralization [@McKemmish:2010]. In the Records Continuum appraisal is less concerned with ascertaining the value of records as it is with the design and implementation of *systems* that generate the records.

### Outside the Archive

The need for appraisal to encompass the record creation process is also reflected in community archives approaches. Community archives extend and build upon postcustodial archival practice by situating the work of appraisal out in the world, in particular social contexts where records are created and actively used [@Flinn:2009]. This movement allows communities to retain custody of their records, which affords more autonomy during the appraisal process. The decisions of what to archive are not being conducted solely by archivists, but also by members of a particular community of people, who are ultimately using the records. Rather than simply treating custody as something to decenter or transcend, because of the material configurations of computer networks and information technology, custody is directly linked to access and the use of records [@Bastian:2001]. Community archives allow for records to take on new historical dimensions, interpretations and use for identity formation [@Punzalan:2009] and collective memory [@Brothman:2001 ; @Jacobsen:2013]. 

It is significant that community archives approaches often develop in response to the systematic erasure, marginalization, or disenfranchisement of particular groups, that is performed by traditional, institutional forms of archives [@Flinn:2007]. In this way community archives speak to the archive as a site and instrument of power [@Jimerson:2013], for social justice [@Punzalan:2016] and even activism [@Cifor:2018]. In the context of social justice, archival appraisal fully admits, and even celebrates, its active political role in shaping and reshaping collective memory and identity [@Harris:2002]. For some, information technologies, such as the web and social media, offer new opportunities for participation, which broaden the set of actors who can perform appraisal, and thus the diversity of records [@Huvila:2008 ; @Gilliland:2014].

More recently there has been a move to position archival appraisal in terms of a feminist ethics of care, which de-emphasizes a rights-oriented, legalistic approach to social justice, which can inadvertently work to reinscribe the very same oppressive systems they are working to dismantle [@Caswell:2016]. The ethics of care approach expresses appraisal and other archival activities in terms of a network of mutual responsibility. These relationships become a conduit for appraisal as a measure of affective value, for deepening engagement with communities and furthering social justice [@Cifor:2016b]. We will turn to a deeper discussion of the ethics of care and its role in understanding web archiving as a set of repair practices shortly.

### Appraising Appraisal

Admittedly, this cursory overview has glossed significant aspects of archival appraisal, while also failing to mention others. However my goal here was not to provide an exhaustive description of the field, but to describe a constellation of divergent and even opposed archival appraisal theories, in order to situate them with Foucault's notion of governmentality. Governmentality helps us to examine appraisal theories as a set of knowledge practices, that orient around organizational structures as well as to individual agency, and reproduce themselves at the levels of societies, states, communities, and even individuals. Appraisal is implicit in the duty to record the activities of the state or administrative body; it works along the grain of organizational hierarchies to document what is deemed most important; and it operates in the service of documenting society, and the interests of democracy and its citizenry. But in a counter movement appraisal also works to decenter the archive as institution, and to locate appraisal practices in systems of record creation and the design of information systems. Appraisal responds to the juridical form of the archive: to create records where none exist, and to reinterpret existing records as part of recursive process that dismantles linear conceptions of the record lifecycle. Appraisal is a tool for social justice that speaks directly to power formations, in order to address oppression and marginalization, while imagining new frames for collective memory. Appraisal even attempts to reconcile the dialectical forces of structure and agency by centering the ethics of care and practice, and moving outside of western human rights based frameworks.
