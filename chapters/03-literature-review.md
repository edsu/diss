# II. Literature Review

This dissertation aims to advance what we know about the practice of appraisal
and selection in the context of web archiving. My examination of this literature
shows that appraisal in web archives has been treated both from a social
perspective in archival studies, and from a technical perspective in digital
library and electronic records. I highlight how appraisal in web archives is
best understood as a sociotechnical practice that does not privilege either
social or technical explanations. Foucault's concept of governmentality provides
a theoretical lens for examining the diverse set of appraisal "theories" present
in archival studies, while recognizing the technical practices of the digital
library research community. The lack of studies that investigate the actual
practices of appraisal in web archives provides an opening for this
dissertation's contribution.

## II.A. Appraisal

Generally speaking the field of archival studies is praxis oriented, in that it
engages with issues of theory in the context of practice. The specific
literature of archival appraisal is a prime example of this praxis orientation.
The problem of appraisal is fundamentally concerned with the practical problem
of how to select material for an archive given 1) an abundance of records, and
2) a finite amount of resources to store all of them. @Cox:1988 consider
appraisal to be the "first responsibility" of the archivist, and define it
broadly as:

> ... any selection activity that enables archivists to identify recorded
> information that has enduring value, primarily for the documentation of
> modern society (p. 29)

In a recent review of the appraisal literature @Anderson:2011 (p. 26)
distinguishes between *appraisal* and *selection*, in order to provide clarity
about when records are evaluated (appraisal) versus when they are chosen
(selected), and when these activities take place relative to an archive taking
custody of the records (accession). However for my purposes here a more
expansive, and generalist, view on appraisal is taken, which admits that
appraisal is a process by which values are asserted about records. These
assertions happen in multiple intersecting timelines and at varying scales that
take shape due to repeated, atomic actions of selection. This more general view
will be important later when appraisal activities are considered in light of the
sociotechnical dimensions of the web.

While archives have existed for millenia [@Posner:1972], it is only over the
past several hundred years that archivists have developed the concept of
appraisal in order to manage the ever increasing deluge of records, that has
been brought upon them, largely by the technologies of record production. Three
years before the web was first prototyped by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN,
@Young:1985 at the Bentley Historical Library reviewed the literature of
archival appraisal in the United States and found 178 monographs, articles,
reports and unpublished manuals. A search in 2018 for *appraisal* after 1985 in
Library and Information Science Source yields some 300 more. A complete and
exhaustive survey of this literature while possibly beneficial, does not serve
my purpose here, which is to connect the literature of archival appraisal with
practices of web archiving. To do this it is useful to examine meta-theories, or
conceptual frameworks that have been used to talk about archival appraisal.

### II.A.1. Archival Meta-theories


@Eastwood:2002 outlines three strains of thinking about archival appraisal that
have developed over the past few centuries of archival studies. The first and
most commonly held view, is that appraisal is a vehicle for history: we must
choose what to remember from the perspective of the future historian who is
attempting to understand today [@Schellenberg:1956]. The second view is that
appraisal (the shaping of the archival record by archivists) is not a task for
the archivist because it is the enemy of authenticity, evidence and the
ultimately the archive itself [@Jenkinson:1922; @Duranti:1994]. The third is
that appraisal is an inherently political act, that necessarily carries with it
the threat of erasure, while also providing opportunities for social justice,
ethical engagement, and as sites for creative record creation [@Harris:2002 ;
@Punzalan:2016].

Eastwood's characterization of appraisal holds up well today, since it casts the
three strands not as an evolution in time, but as a bricolage of approaches that
coexist and function simultaneously. However it is important to note that
Eastwood discusses these three strands of appraisal against a backdrop of
Western democratic societies. Eastwood's thesis is that appraisal practices and
theories are put to work in the service of democracy, and are to be understood
ultimately as a tool for governance and accountability. This is a theme that I
will return too shortly. But before I do that I want to examine another
appraisal meta-theory.

In her recent study of appraisal practices @Foscarini:2017 draws on the work of
@Cook:2013 to describe the discursive tensions that exist in the research
literature about archival appraisal. Cook identified a general timeline of
archival paradigms:

> I want to suggest that since the later nineteenth century, archival 
> identity has shifted, or has been in the process of shifting, through 
> four such paradigms or frameworks or mindsets, as it has struggled, and 
> still struggles, with this memory-evidence tension. I am calling the 
> four frameworks: evidence, memory, identity, and community. It is 
> important to emphasize that these four accumulate across time; they 
> do not entirely replace each other.

Foscarini takes up these four paradigms to examine how they manifest in various
theoretical approaches to appraisal, which largely orient around what can be
seen as top-down and bottom-up approaches. In top-down approaches (evidence and
memory) the archivist intervenes as little as possible in the service of
authenticity and integrity [@Jenkinson:1922], or they analyze organizational
hierarchies, structures and activities in an attempt to document society as a
whole [@Cook:2004a]. In the bottom-up approach (identity and community)
appraisal is recognized as a creative activity, in which history, memory and
social relations are assembled as part of a complex set of activities that are
not necessarily centered on an institutional context. Foscarini goes on to note
that these ideas about appraisal are not steps along a timeline, but are all
still very much with us. For example, much of the last few decades of work in
digital preservation have been focused on the design and development of
technologies for ensuring authenticity and integrity of data, with the implicit
and governing assumption that technology can, or should, allow us to perfectly
collect everything.

I am offering my own meta-theory of appraisal specifically for web archives,
which relies on Foucault's idea of governmentality as a framework for
understanding the full scope of appraisal theories, in their social and
historical contexts [@Foucault:1991]. So before diving into these details it is
important to first take a look at *governmentality*, which we will return to
later as an example of a practice orientation to web archives.

###  II.A.2. Governmentality

The records from our earliest archives happen to be coterminous with the
beginnings of recorded human history. This is no coincidence given that the
methods of history depend in large part on the evidence of the past that
survives, and this evidence is often found in archival repositories of various
kinds. As such, archives are often seen as historiographical instruments. The
disciplines of history and archival studies are twinned, but their relations are
somewhat antagonistic. Historians are one of the most active users of archives.
The records collected in archives are used by historians as evidence of previous
events and activities, which are essential for piecing together and anchoring
historical narratives in fact, or as close as can be got to fact many years
later. Until the professionalization of archival studies, it was common for
archivists to be trained historians, with invested knowledge of the events,
people and organizations that the archive is ostensibly concerned with. Who
better to tend to the records of an organization than the scholar who knows its
history? It wasn't until archivists began to meaningfully grapple with the
concept of *appraisal* that an understanding of the archive developed that was
more than simply the tool of memory and history [@Taylor:1984], but also as an
political and economic instrument of power, accountability, resistance and
liberation [@Jimerson:2009].

The archival practices of southern Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, which archival
studies points to for its origin story (at least in Western traditions), are
examples from the earliest known states used archives to manage records of laws,
administrative activities, financial transactions, land ownership, and taxation
[@Posner:1972 ; @OToole:2004]. These archives reflected the interests of the
earliest states in governing and controlling their populations. Similarly the
gaps in records, and their silences, work to demarcate those on the periphery of
the state, or outside it altogether [@Scott:2017]. A significant portion of the
stories of archives are thus bound up with the interests of institutions,
states, governance and what @Foucault:1991 calls *governmentality*.

For Foucault governmentality is a mode of rationality of governing through
technologies of power, that reproduce themselves through specific practices.
Governmentality is not simply the story of the operations of the state, but is
concerned with "the conduct of conduct", and can be found in the practices of
individuals, households, families and communities. Foucault traces the emergence
of the art of government and political economy, and situates it with the decline
of the sovereign, the birth of the modern state, and more recently,
neo-liberalism. Governmentality is a useful instrument because it provides a
continuous field that includes many modes of archival production and appraisal.
It provides a frame for looking at appraisal landscapes as a form of knowledge
(savoir), that has particular rules of formation, transformation and correlation
with other practices. As noted by @Schwartz:2002:

> Archives have always been about power, whether it is the power of the state, 
> the church, the corporation, the family, the public, or the individual. 
> Archives have the power to privilege and to marginalize. They can be a tool
> of hegemony; they can be a tool of resistance. They both reflect and 
> constitute power relations. They are a product of society's need for
> information, and the abundance and circulation of documents reflects the
> importance placed on information in society. They are the basis for and
> validation of the stories we tell ourselves, the story-telling narratives 
> that give cohesion and meaning to individuals, groups and societies.
> (p. 13)

Foucault's idea of governmentality is useful for tracing practices of archival
appraisal, or the practices of deciding what to remember and forget, because of
the insights it brings into how appraisal practices function as part of the
sociotechnical assemblages of archives and their manifestations in the web. But
before turning to look at web archives I want to briefly outline a genealogy of
appraisal practices that foregrounds governmentality.

###  II.A.3. Tacit Appraisal

Despite the millennial historical arc of archival practice, Western archival
studies often locates its theoretical origins in the concept of *respect des
fonds*, or more commonly, *provenance* from 19th century France. Respect des
fonds is a practice of grouping records by their creator, rather than by subject
matter or some other predetermined taxonomy. In practice this means records are
grouped together by the organization, family, or individual that created them.
As @Bailey:2013a describes, the introduction of provenance occurred in the
aftermath of the French Revolution, which saw the simultaneous destruction and
reconstruction of records; a truly monumental attempt to both erase and
refashion the historical record in the newly established Archives Nationales.
While attempting to deal with this project the librarian, archivist and
historian Natalis de Wailly introduced the idea of *respect des fonds* in 1841
as a simplified practice for arranging the records:

> The principle was, in fact, a practical exigency, a method to 
> simplify archival arrangement seen as more easily implemented
> by novice archivists than the more rigorous arrangement by 
> classification. @Bailey:2013a

It is significant to note that this use of provenance as a heuristic for organizing records was born amidst what was effectively a massive appraisal process, in which overtly political interests determined the preservation of pre and post-revolution records. However, the concept of appraisal was not itself explicitly part of the expression of respect des fonds. The question of what to keep and what to discard was subsumed into a practice for processing the pre-revolutionary materials.

Despite its partial application in France, respect des fonds proved popular as
it spread to Belgium and the Netherlands, where it became part of the *Manual
for the Arrangement and Description of Archives* [@Muller:1940], that was
originally published in 1898. The so called *Dutch Manual* added to to the
concept of respect des fonds an additional principle named *original order*,
which stated that the arrangement of records should be the same as the original
organization. In their manual the authors Muller, Feith and Fruin describe how
records are created during the activities of administrative bodies or officials
that operate using the metaphor of a life-form:

> ... an archival collection is an organic whole, a living organism 
> which grows, takes shape, and undergoes changes in accordance with 
> fixed rules. If the functions of the body change, the nature of the 
> archival collection changes likewise. The rules which govern the 
> composition, the arrangement and the formation of an archival 
> collection, therefore, cannot be fixed by the archivist in advance; 
> he can only study the organism and ascertain the rules under which 
> it was formed. (p. 19)

Even here the idea of appraisal, or the decision of what to keep and what to
discard, is tacit. The concept of original order works to prevent the reordering
or disruption of records that have *already* arrived as *archival*. The decision
of what administrative bodies and officials to collect has already been made,
and the principle of original order works to govern how the records are to be
arranged and described once they arrive. The surprisingly fresh conception of
records as both product and part of a form of life (organicity), still works to
bracket off appraisal as something that has already happened out of band. The
fact that an administrative body is generating the records is enough to
transmute the documents from mere papers into *archival records* that are to be
preserved for the long term. The process of governance is at work in the very
conception of how the archive functions.

###  II.A.4. Realizing Appraisal

In the early 20th century, Hillary Jenkinson imported the concept of respect des fonds from continental Europe and fused it with existing English archival practices in his influential *Manual of Archival Administration*. Jenkinson was a medievalist by training, and stressed the importance of impartiality, authenticity and naturalness (similar to organicity) in archival practice. These three principles coordinate to position the archivist as the *keeper* of records, and proscribes the archivist from acting in any way to shape was is made archival. While Jenkinson admits that decisions need to be made about what to keep, these decisions are made by the record creator, before the records are added to an archive, and not by the archivist after the fact. More recently @Duranti:1994 connects ideas around authenticity to the theory of *diplomatics*, the critical and forensic analysis of documents, which she traces back to the practice of Roman law in the 11th century. Notice here that the locus of appraisal is still in the hands of officials working within administrative bodies, in the bureaucracies of power.

@Tschan:2002 suggests that much of the last century of archival thinking can be
characterized as a sustained conversation between Jenkinson's Manual on the one
hand, where archival appraisal is verboten and authenticity is paramount, and
another manual *Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques* written by historian
and archivist Theodore Schellenberg. Schellenberg's manual was written after
World War Two, in a moment when record production was vastly outstripping the
ability to store them. In his position at the US National Archives and Records
Administration, Schellenberg recognized that pragmatic decisions needed to be
made about what records to make *archival*, and that those decisions were
essentially assertions about value, of which there were two kinds: primary and
secondary.

Primary value was the value of the records to the record creator, in their
active use. Secondary value on the other hand divided into two subtypes:
*evidential* and *informational*. On the surface *evidential value* seems to be
quite similar in principle to Jenkinson's interest in impartiality, authenticity
and naturalness. However Schellberg makes clear that he is not concerned with
the fidelity of the records as evidence, but with how well the records function
as evidence of the organization and function of a particular government body:

> By evidential value I do not refer here to the value that 
> inheres in public records because of the merit of the 
> evidence they contain. I do not refer, in a Jenkinsonian sense,
> to the sanctity of the evidence in archives that is derived
> from "unbroken custody." I refer rather, and quite arbitrarily, 
> to a value that depends on the importance of the matter
> evidenced, i.e. the organization and functioning of the 
> agency that produced the records.

Schellenberg outlined a variety of criteria to use for assessing the evidentiary
value of records, which crucially links the volume of records with
organizational hierarchy:

![Personnel Distribution United States Civil Service Commission, p. 143](images/schellenberg1.png)

In contrast, *information value* is determined by the archivist in a subjective
way, that takes into account the historical moment that the records were created
in, and often involves outside consultation with relevant subject matter
specialists. Schellenberg, himself trained as a historian, notes that many
archivists themselves are historians and thus are "competent to ascertain the
historical values of public records" [@Schellenberg:1956 p. 150]. As opposed to
a highly structured approach, Schellenberg stressed that determinations of
*informational value* by archivists resist consistency and systematization. As a
result measures of *informational value* will be different in different
contexts, and that "diverse judgments may well assure a more adequate social
documentation". 

Even with these allowances for contextual variation, Schellenberg's notions of
evidential and informational are significantly framed by the institutional and
governmental context. This is plainly seen in his use of the hierarchy of
government as a mode of selection in Figure 1. In addition, judgments about
historical significance made by archivists and other subject specialists, are
key to establishing information value, but are themselves bound up and subject
to less visible professional structures of power, which are left largely
unexamined. Into this gap we see the final stage in top-down approaches, as the
unit of analysis moves from the level of the state up yet further to that of
society at large.

###  II.A.5. Documenting Society

The archival theorist Terry Cook was an eloquent archival theorist, most
remembered for his ability to synthesize archival theory, and mobilize it for
work in the present, particularly in the service of appraisal. His theory of
*macroappraisal* provides a framework for shifting focus away from the value of
records, and towards the values inherent in the functional context that records
are created in [@Cook:2005a]. When using macroappraisal archivists study the
functions and structures of government and organizations, while specifically
attending to the effects that these institutions have on their citizenry and in
aggregate, society as a whole. 

> Macroappraisal is thus a provenance-based approach to appraisal, where 
> the social context of the record’s creation and contemporary use (not 
> its anticipated research use) establishes its relative value. (p. 128)

Cooks' articulation of macroappraisal was born in the aftermath of Canada's
Deschênes Commission on Nazi War Criminals, which uncovered how a large number
of immigration records were inadvertently destroyed by the Canadian National
Archives. The controversy sensitized Cook to the abject failure of
Schellenberg's concept of *informational value*, or the historical determination
of record value. It led him to instead focus attention on present value, instead
of future anticipated use, and to anchor that value on a determination of how
citizens were impacted by an organization's activities. Cook drew heavily on
German archival theorist @Booms:1987, who argued against state controlled
appraisal, under repressive Soviet-style communism, and advocated for a view of
archival appraisal that measured the interests of society as a whole:

> In our view, a legitimate value standard or principle for the 
> archival appraisal process can only be derived from this kind of 
> contemporary valuation. Such a standard is inherent in history itself, 
> for it is a standard of the past. It is not the product of speculation 
> or ideological beliefs; it does not do violence to source material 
> by applying value standards of the present which in the near future 
> may already prove to be inadequate. If there is indeed anything or 
> anyone qualified to lend legitimacy to archival appraisal, it is 
> society itself, and the public opinions it expresses-
> assuming, of course, that these are allowed to develop freely. (p. 104)

Here we come full circle with the idea of archival appraisal as reflective of
the goals of democratic societies as discussed earlier [@Eastwood:2002]. Even
with its focus on the state, its citizenry and society as a whole,
macroappraisal foregrounds a particular governance structure that supports the
needs of a democracy and even (in the case of Booms) notions of social opinion
and the marketplace of ideas. While fully aware of the political role that
appraisal takes in shaping memory, Cook understands appraisal as a tuning of the
machinery of the state, to bring it in line with the interests and well being of
its citizenry.

Booms' emphasis on the importance of public opinion is certainly understandable,
and even laudable, when faced with state sanctioned repression, violence and
media censorship. However an unquestioned reliance on a market for determining
public opinion, without a critical engagement with the systems that generate
those markets is problematic. Foucault's concept of governmentality is useful
for unpacking and factoring these social and market forces, to see them  not
only at work in the functions of government, but also in the distributed
material practices of individuals, and communities. Understanding how to measure
popular opinion, or the impact of records on people, and some approaches that
archives have taken to a form of appraisal that speaks directly to it political
agency is where we turn next.

###  II.A.6. Appraisal Critique

In contrast to governance based approaches to archival appraisal are a group of
divergent theories that speak directly to, and work to counter, the obscured,
and often erased, influence and effects of power in archives. As we saw
previously, structural approaches to appraisal often define appraisal implicitly
by outlining principles of original order and provenance that map to an
institutional or societal context. In emphasizing the central role of provenance
in structuring the archive, certain assumptions are made about what records get
to count as archival, who creates them, and what resources are required to
mobilize them as an archive. Another group of appraisal practices in archives
speak to the archive as a site for record *creation*, not simply preservation.
Archival records are part of a larger landscape of memory in which archival
records circulate. These bottom up style approaches to appraisal archivists
fully engage, and take political responsibility for, their role as shapers of
the archival record, and the limits that their actions impose.

In a memorable, and oft quoted, address to the Society of American Archivists in
1974, @Ham:1975 issued a wakeup call for archivists and their practice of
appraisal:

> Our most important and intellectually demanding task as archivists is to 
> make an informed selection of information that will provide the future with 
> a representative record of human experience in our time. But why must we 
> do it so badly? Is there any other field of information gathering that 
> has such a broad mandate with a selection process so random, so 
> fragmented, so uncoordinated, and even so often accidental? (p. 5)

Ham highlighted the lack of theorization around appraisal in order to make a
plea for increased cooperation, empirical analysis, funding, and intellectual
openness for archival appraisal. In many ways Ham was echoing a similar call by
historian Howard Zinn, who addressed the same body a few years earlier saying
that the archivist had a responsibility to document the lives of ordinary
citizens and political movements, to hold power accountable through
transparency, and to consciously work against the status quo in archives where

> ... the existence, preservation, and availability of archives, 
> documents, records in our society are very much determined by 
> the distribution of wealth and power. That is, the most powerful, 
> the richest elements in society have the greatest capacity to find 
> documents, preserve them, and decide what is or is not available 
> to the public. This means government, business, and the military 
> are dominant.

Zinn's insights here continue to reverberate in archival studies especially when
considering the process of appraisal. He foregrounds the hegemonic shape of
archives, and challenges the archival community to not only hold the
disciplinary form of the archive accountable, but also to move archival work
outside of its governmental enclosure. In many ways this recognition of the role
of power in shaping archives marks the birth of appraisal theory. It is in the
moment when one can see the dominant mold of archives and its historical form
that it becomes possible to talk about how that power has manifested in the
records that have been collected and cared for in an archive [@Jimerson:2009].
Foucault's exploration of the role of governmentality is instructive here
because he lets us see how power works through the state, but also through
disciplinary forms such as the family, the school, the factory, and the prison.

### II.A.7. Strategy

Documentation Strategies is an appraisal technique developed by Helen Samuels as
she worked to document university life at the Massachusetts Institute for
Technology. For Samuels the archivist works as an analyst in a *distributed
network* to study the social forces that generate records, rather than the
records themselves. Samuels articulated four parts to developing a documentation
strategy: 1) choosing a topic to be documented, 2) selecting the site for the
strategy 3) examining the form and substance available documentation, 4)
selecting and placing the documentation. This general
strategy-for-developing-strategies, or meta-strategy, was distilled down to an
appraisal technique known as Institutional Functional Analysis which bears some
resemblance to Cook's macroappraiasl, particularly in its attention the
functions and societal impacts of institutions.

However, Samuels' crucial insight was that a *network* of analysts and
repositories would be needed to address the challenge. A documentation strategy
was not concerned with the decisions of a single archivist working within the
hierarchical structure of a single institution. This networked approach mirrors
Samuels' interest in emerging practices around the use of automated computer
networks such as OCLC, RLG and at the distribution of machine readable
cataloging data at Library of Congress [@Samuels:1986]. A key aspect to
Documentation Strategies is deciding where records are to be held, which may or
may not be at the archivists own institution.

Significantly, Samuels also recognized that a documentation strategy may
identify gaps in the documentary record, and could in fact suggest the
*creation* of records where none currently exist. 

> While archivists acknowledge the overabundance of information, they 
> also recognize that modern communication patterns and records-keeping 
> practices leave gaps in the documentary record. Documentation strategies, 
> however, are ongoing activities and provide the opportunity to intervene 
> in the records creation process and assure the creation and retention 
> of required information. [@Samuels:1986 p121-122]

Seeing archival appraisal as an intervention and as a potentially creative act
was a surprisingly radical move, especially given the vast number of records
already in need of preservation, and the anxiety about preserving them.

###  II.A.8. Decentralization

This shift in attention outside the walls of the physical archive suggested by
Documentation Strategies was in fact part of a longer movement in archival
studies that often gets labeled *postcustodial*. The term postcustodial was
first used by @Ham:1984 in drawing attention to the ways in which information
technology and automation were dramatically transforming the landscape of record
production, and the concomitant need for the archival studies field to invest in
researching these new forms of record production, in order to adequately
preserve and provide access to them. A decade later @Cook:1993 synthesized a
significant body of work by @Taylor:1988, @Bearman:1989, @Hedstrom:1991 under
the rubric of *postcustodial*, which he aligned with post-modern theories of
archives. For these postcustodialists a transformation of archival theory, and
especially appraisal, was absolutely necessary because of the proliferation of
electronic media, which resist the idea of a singular documentary artifact.

> In this fluid electronic environment, the idea of a record 
> physically belonging in one place or even in one system is crumbling 
> before new conceptual paradigms, where "creatorship" is a more fluid 
> process of manipulating information from many sources in a myriad of
> ways, or applications, rather than something leading to a static, fixed,
> physical product. For information professionals, this signals that the 
> custodial era is giving way to a postcustodial one, where the curatorship
> of physical objects will define our professions much less than will 
> an understanding of the conceptual or virtual interrelationships between
> creating structures, their animating functions, programmes, and 
> activities, the information systems, and the resulting records. 
> [@Cook:1993, p.424]

Postcustodial thinkers emphasize that appraisal is not simply a valuation of
records during record acquisition, but is inherent in the design and
construction of information systems: "archivists need to reexamine how
information systems support organizational functions and relate to
organizational structure within specific organizations and in a broader
documentary context" [@Hedstrom:1991, p. 344]. Postcustodial archival theory
crystallized in the Records Continuum model, which dismantles the idea of a
linear life cycle for records in which the archive is the place where records
come to rest. The Records Continuum instead stresses how archival records are
part of multiple, recursive, processual flows, as they cycle between creation,
capture, organization and pluralization [@McKemmish:2010]. In the Records
Continuum appraisal is less concerned with ascertaining the value of records as
it is with the design and implementation of *systems* that generate the records.

###  II.A.9. Outside the Archive

The need for appraisal to encompass the record creation process is also reflected in community archives approaches. Community archives extend and build upon postcustodial archival practice by situating the work of appraisal out in the world, in particular social contexts where records are created and actively used [@Flinn:2009]. This movement allows communities to retain custody of their records, which affords more autonomy during the appraisal process. The decisions of what to archive are not being conducted solely by archivists, but also by members of a particular community of people, who are ultimately using the records. Rather than simply treating custody as something to decenter or transcend, because of the material configurations of computer networks and information technology, custody is directly linked to access and the use of records [@Bastian:2001]. Community archives allow for records to take on new historical dimensions, interpretations and use for identity formation [@Punzalan:2009] and collective memory [@Brothman:2001 ; @Jacobsen:2013]. 

It is significant that community archives approaches often develop in response
to the systematic erasure, marginalization, or disenfranchisement of particular
groups, that is performed by traditional, institutional forms of archives
[@Flinn:2007]. In this way community archives speak to the archive as a site and
instrument of power [@Jimerson:2013], for social justice [@Punzalan:2016] and
even activism [@Cifor:2018]. In the context of social justice, archival
appraisal fully admits, and even celebrates, its active political role in
shaping and reshaping collective memory and identity [@Harris:2002]. For some,
information technologies, such as the web and social media, offer new
opportunities for participation, which broaden the set of actors who can perform
appraisal, and thus the diversity of records [@Huvila:2008 ; @Gilliland:2014].

More recently there has been a move to position archival appraisal in terms of a
feminist ethics of care, which de-emphasizes a rights-oriented, legalistic
approach to social justice, which can inadvertently work to reinscribe the very
same oppressive systems they are working to dismantle [@Caswell:2016]. The
ethics of care approach expresses appraisal and other archival activities in
terms of a network of mutual responsibility. These relationships become a
conduit for appraisal as a measure of affective value, for deepening engagement
with communities and furthering social justice [@Cifor:2016b]. We will turn to a
deeper discussion of the ethics of care and its role in understanding web
archiving as a set of repair practices shortly.

### II.A.10. Appraising Appraisal

Admittedly, this cursory overview has glossed significant aspects of archival
appraisal, while also failing to mention others. However my goal here was not to
provide an exhaustive description of the field, but to describe a constellation
of divergent and even opposed archival appraisal theories, in order to situate
them with Foucault's notion of governmentality. Governmentality helps us to
examine appraisal theories as a set of knowledge practices, that orient around
organizational structures as well as to individual agency, and reproduce
themselves at the levels of societies, states, communities, and even
individuals. Appraisal is implicit in the duty to record the activities of the
state or administrative body; it works along the grain of organizational
hierarchies to document what is deemed most important; and it operates in the
service of documenting society, and the interests of democracy and its
citizenry. But in a counter movement appraisal also works to decenter the
archive as institution, and to locate appraisal practices in systems of record
creation and the design of information systems. Appraisal responds to the
juridical form of the archive: to create records where none exist, and to
reinterpret existing records as part of recursive process that dismantles linear
conceptions of the record lifecycle. Appraisal is a tool for social justice that
speaks directly to power formations, in order to address oppression and
marginalization, while imagining new frames for collective memory. Appraisal
even attempts to reconcile the dialectical forces of structure and agency by
centering the ethics of care and practice, and moving outside of western human
rights based frameworks.

## II.B. Appraisal and Web Archives

And so we return to the question that we started with: how are we deciding what
to archive from the web? Or, how does the constellation of archival praxis
around appraisal that we have just discussed meet up with web archiving
practices?  You will notice that so far there has been very little discussion of
the actual materials that are the subject of appraisal. It's almost as if our
theories of appraisal are thought to function independently of the material
being appraised; that in principle (if not in fact) appraisal can be applied as
needed to all forms of media. Indeed, this abstractedness is part of appraisal's
claim to theory in the first place, and forming part of an archival *science*.

However the birth of appraisal, or the awareness that records *must* be
selected, in some fashion, by the archivist, occurs in a particular historical
moment of profound material transformation, as the technologies of record
production completely outstrip the archivists ability to process their outputs.
This *overcoming* of the archivist, and the concomitant appraisal response, are
not simply the result of an increased volume of records, or information overload
[@Ham:1981]. The concept of archival appraisal arrives as the centuries old
archival technologies of paper, print and their containers are giving way to a
proliferation of electronic media formations, which challenged and continue to
challenge the archival imagination [@Taylor:1988]. @Cook:1994 suggests that
appraisal is perhaps more of a sensibility than an abstract theory, for the way
it offers an approach to practice, and a consolation amidst this transformation:

> Most important, for the first time, we are not producing, managing, 
> and saving physical things or artifacts, but rather trying to understand 
> and preserve logical and virtual patterns that give electronic information 
> its structure, content, and context, and thus its meaning as a "record" 
> or as evidence of acts and transactions.

Here Cook casually deploys the idea of "virtual" records and the effects that
they are having on archival practice. This virtuality derives at least in part
from how computer technology collapses the media forms of word, picture, sound,
video into a seemingly uniform binary representation--the so called
ones-and-zeroes of digitality. However electronic records, especially
born-digital-records, of which the web is a prime example, have actual material
dimensions, and condense as the result of processual flows that involve
platforms, infrastructures, networks, heuristics and algorithms. The virtuality
of electronic records can be understood as what @Kirschenbaum:2008 calls a
"screen essentialism" or medial ideology that effaces the instrumentation that
creates, and must constantly recreate, the experience of an electronic document.
At the same time, archives of the web are particularly prone to a technological
solutionism that treats preservation as a purely technical problem, where we
simply need more efficient and less error prone storage, more comprehensive
crawling strategies, or improved network protocols in order to "archive it all".

Despite efforts to archive the entire web [@Kahle:2007], the idea of a complete
archive of the web remains both economically infeasible [@Rosenthal:2012], and
theoretically intractable [@Masanes:2006]. Features of the web’s Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP), such as code-on-demand [@Fielding:2000], content
caching [@Fielding:2014] and personalization [@Barth:2011], have transformed
what was originally conceived of as a document oriented hypertext system into a
complex multimedia information infrastructure that delivers content based on who
you are, when you ask, and what software you use [@BernersLee:2000]. As a
result, the very notion of a singular documentary artifact, which has been under
significant strain since the introduction of photography [@Benjamin:1999a] and
electronic records [@Bearman:1989], is now being pushed to its theoretical and
conceptual breaking point. We rarely try to reason about *all* archival records
that exist in the world as a singular assemblage. So why do we do this so
naturally with the network of networks that we call the Internet, or the
massively distributed text that is the web? Dissolving the seeming virtuality of
web archives, and understanding both the web and web archives as social,
historical and technical artifacts is essential for being able to talk about how
web content is being selected for preservation (and access) in an archive. Now
that we are 30 years into the web's existence we are in a position to turn from
the innovation-centric approaches to web archives, to the critical investigation
of established practices.

### II.B.1. Science and Technology Studies

In the early days of the web @Hedstrom:1991 proposed a broad research framework
for the study of *electronic records*, or what some today might call
computational archival systems. This framework was based on a *sociotechnical*
understanding of archives that recognized the need for archival studies research
to move beyond technological determinist accounts, where society is shaped by
technology, as well as overly socially determinist accounts, where technology is
shaped purely by social and political interests. In *sociotechnical* accounts
both technology and society must be understood in terms of a complex interplay
between people, materials and processes, where the technical and the social
mutually shape, or coproduce, each other. This line of inquiry is especially
relevant today,and builds upon the rich empirical foundations of Science and
Technology Studies (STS) [@Bijke:1987 ; @Latour:1987 ; @Felt:2007].

Hedstrom's framework for research into electronic records included 1) the
relationship between automation, electronic records and organizational change;
2) new material forms of electronic records and their remediation of previous
forms; 3) the design of new information systems with archival properties; 4)
evolving markets for information technology and their impacts on archival
records; and 5) the impact of electronic records on accepted norms and
approaches to archival preservation (e.g. provenance and appraisal). Hedstrom
stressed how attending to the social, historical and material dimensions of
information technology, was the cornerstone of archival studies:

> The introduction of new forms of material and the simultaneous 
> transformation of traditional forms into something new raises a series 
> of questions about the relationship between forms of material and archival
> practice. When should new forms of material be managed differently from 
> more traditional forms of documentation? Are there any archival 
> principles that apply to all new electronic record types? What
> characteristics does an electronic memo share with a memo on paper? What 
> does it have in common with other machine-readable records?

Hedstrom's framework holds up particularly well today, as many of these five areas have developed into full fledged fields of study. But this development, at least for the study of web archives, has mostly happened either in the domain of computer science where the concept of appraisal is infrequently used, or in the field of archival studies where the web is considered under the rubric of electronic records. Before discussing how STS can be applied to the study of appraisal in web archives I will briefly characterize these literatures and their perspective on web archives.

### II.B.2. Digital Libraries

The computer science literature reflects a decade long interest in *digital
libraries*, particularly the research output of Joint Conference on Digital
Libraries (JCDL), that for the last 20 years has served as a research forum for
all manner of investigations into novel methods for collecting, storing,
indexing, accessing and preserving content collected from the web. When it comes
to appraisal, digital library research on the subject of web archives has
focused in large part on the problems of *harvesting* or *crawling* the web.
Practices for crawling the web for the purposes of indexing and maintenance are
nearly as old as the web itself [@Fielding:1994]. However the actual dimensions
of the web are still difficult to determine [@Dobra:2004], and the "deep web"
presents challenges because of the way large regions of the web are hidden
behind human driven query interfaces [@Madhavan:2008].

Substantial work has been done to measure the *archivability* of web content
[@Banos:2015 ; @Samar:2014] and to determine the age of web resources
[@SalahEldeen:2013], which are important factors to consider when deciding what
to archive. Another significant consideration is the expected disappearance of a
resource from the web. Numerous studies have investigated the transience of web
resources, so called link decay, link rot, or reference rot, in order to
characterize the likelihood of certain types of web content disappearing.
Measures of link rot can be used to mobilize efforts at increased web archiving
generally, as well as specific areas such as social media [@SalahEldeen:2013b] ,
science [@Hennessey:2013], institutional repositories [@Sanderson:2011], and
jurisprudence [@Zittrain:2014].

The problem of knowing what to collect from the web has also been treated in the
digital library research community as a *focused crawling* problem. In focused
crawling the goal is to collect content about particular topics [@Risse:2012],
events [@Yang:2012 ; @Klein:2018], or to collect content that has a particular
characteristic such as popularity [@Page:1999], importance @BaezaYates:2005] or
social engagement [@Gossen:2015a ; @Nwala:2018 ; @Milligan:2016]. Generally
speaking these approaches take the focus to be a topic, event, person,
organization that can be qualified by the types of media (documents, audio,
video). These criteria are taken as a priori, or a given, that is decided out of
band, before the task of doing the crawling is undertaken. Similarly there is
also a vast research literature on relevancy ranking in web search results that
is dependent first on having already amassed a collection of web documents to
index. However how that corpus of documents has been assembled is usually taken
as a given. Despite the lack of the use of the term appraisal, this vein of
digital library research speaks to Hedstrom's call for archival studies to
directly engage in the design of record keeping technologies for the web.

### II.B.3. Electronic Records

Within the field of archival studies there are numerous accounts of how
appraisal applies to electronic records, but less so with regard to the web
specifically. The term *electronic records* developed alongside computer
automation to refer to the databases, electronic mail archives, and other types
of data that accrue as *files* on a computer file system. These computer
filesystems used the metaphors of paper based documents, files and containers
for storing them, in order to make familiar a completely new information
infrastructure. Designating these computer files as electronic records
highlights how computer data is generated as part of the functioning of
organizations, and provides evidence of that operation, in which authenticity,
reliability and fixity are typically paramount [@Duranti:2010 ; @Cobb:2005 ;
@Harvey:2010]. Discussion of electronic records also happens under the rubric of
digital preservation [@Rothenberg:1999] or digital curation [@Yakel:2007]. In
addition to the preservation of computer files and filesystems researchers have
worked on means of format identification [@Hitchcock:2007] and pursued the use
of software emulation to preserve and describe entire software systems
[@Welch:2012 ; @McDonough:2010]. @Lee:2011a suggest that the term *digital
curation* reflects a postcustodial response to digital preservation, that
foregrounds the site of record production as outside the walls of the archive,
instead of focusing entirely on the authenticity and fixity of data, and
conventional ideas of the preservation lifecycle.

Electronic records, digital preservation and digital curation are largely
predicated on prior custody of data, or the ready access to the computer systems
(software and hardware) that the data has been produced on. These approaches
tend to take as a given that the data is in fact available, and generally do not
speak directly about the process of archival appraisal, or the social and
technical means by which data is selected for preservation in an archive. As
such the web presents a conundrum of sorts, where content *appears* openly
available, and is often regarded as *public*. But even as they seem
ready-to-hand, web documents also exist at a distance, sometimes in multiple
locations, and are retrieved across blurred geopolitical boundaries, which the
infrastructure of the Internet and the architecture of the web (when working)
makes instantly available in the web browser.

Many accounts of the appraisal of web content take a case study approach where
web content is collected to document a particular event or category of content.
For example @Masanes:2006 examines the identification and crawling of websites
relating to the French presidential and parliamentary elections in 2002 by the
Bibliothèque nationale de France. In another prominent study @Schneider:2003a
detail approaches to creating a collection of web content at the Library of
Congress related to the September 11 terrorist attacks. Changes to copyright law
enabled national libraries to evaluate both broad and focused approaches to
archiving entire top-level-domains (e.g. .fr or .pt) [@Lasfargues:2008 and
@Gomes:2006]. The need for tools that allow *seed lists* (lists of URLs to
archive) to be developed was articulated by @Pearce:2005. @Duncan:2016 describe
how networks, such as professional consortia, are useful resources for curating
seed lists. In addition there has been discussion of the use of social media and
their Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as a means for discovering web
content for archiving events such the Arab Spring [@Arnold:2014] and the
protests in Ferguson and the #BlackLivesMatter social movement [@Rollason:2015].
Web archives are also considered as a site for critical engagement with issues
of social justice [@Aronson:2017].

In one of the more conceptual models of appraisal in web archives @Masanes:2006b
analyzed the process of *selection*, which is broken down into three different
phases: preparation, discovery and filtering. Preparation involves establishing
a focus for the collection, as well as selecting the technology for performing
the collection. Discovery involves the act of collection itself, which leverages
both the structure of the web (endogenous) as well as external resources such as
search engines and link hubs (heterogeneous). Filtering is a process by which
collected material is selected for an archive based on quality, subject, genre
and publisher. Masanès discusses the degree to which automation can be used in
these three phases, but unlike the previously mentioned case studies the
discussion is prospective and largely unanchored from actual practice. For
example, whether and how archivists are involved in the filtering of collected
web content is not explored.

The architecture of the web presents blurry geographies, where it is not always
clear where one website ends and another begins. The idea of a singular
document, which is central to information science [@Buckland:1991], is put under
strain by the web's use of hypermedia, which allows documents to be dynamically
composed from heterogeneous sources. Practices for appraising the web diverges
significantly from electronic records in that it necessarily involves collecting
or assembling content from the Internet. Appraising web content also requires
the means and mechanisms for reassembly, or replay, of the content later
[@Andersen:2013] in order to assess what has been collected. This recursive
assembly and reassembly of content is tightly bound up with the appraisal
process itself, and is achieved with specialized tools [@Mohr:2004], that have
particular design assumptions, goals and affordances built into them.

Zooming out from the technical specifics, appraisal in web archives also can be
seen as a form of virtual reunification [@Punzalan:2014] where who the various
stakeholders are, their conceptions of process and product, and goals in
creating the archive are made manifest. However in the case of web archives this
reunification was always already virtual, at least in the sense that they were
very often born digital, as part of the accrual of data and documents in the
network. Unpacking the very real social and material processes and practices
that underlie the virtuality presented by the web archive is a key component to
understanding how archival appraisal on the web works.

## II.C. Appraisal Practice

So far I have outlined how ideas of archival appraisal have developed over time,
with the goal of showing how these conceptions are used (and not used) in the
research literature of web archives. In examining the research literature of
appraisal I have drawn on Foucault's idea of *governmentality* as a way of
understanding how a wide set of archival appraisal practices reflect, repeat and
respond to concerns of governance. However, for Foucault governmentality is
about much more than simply the affairs of government and state: it also
includes the practices of individuals, families and groups of all kinds:

> This word [government] must be allowed the very broad meaning it had in 
> the sixteenth century. "Government" did not refer only to political 
> structures or to the management of states; rather, it designated the way 
> in which the conduct of individuals or of groups might be directed:
> the government of children, of souls, of communities, of the sick. It did
> not only cover the legitimately constituted forms of political or economic
> subjection but also modes of action, more or less considered or calculated,
> which were destined to act upon the possibilities of action of other people.
> To govern, in this sense, is to structure the possible field of action for
> others. [@Foucault:1982, p. 790]

Foucault developed the concept of governmentality by examining how institutions
like hospitals, schools, prisons, barracks, and even archives [@Foucault:1986]
work to discipline, and delimit the field of action. Foucault's examination of
specific practices and their relations is considered by many to be part of a
general turn to practice in social theory. @Postill:2010 identifies Foucault as
part of a first wave of practice theorists that also includes Ludwig
Wittgenstein, Pierre Bourdieu, Anthony Giddens, and Michel de Certeau. He
characterizes these thinkers as working to:

> ... liberate agency -- the human ability to act upon and 
> change the world -- from the constrictions of structuralist and systemic 
> models while avoiding the trap of methodological individualism. These 
> theorists regarded the human body as the nexus of people's practical 
> engagements with the world. (p. 7)

Practice theorists are interested in resolving the dialectic between individual
agency and the social and material structures that constrain and reproduce it,
through a material examination of the processes and routines that center on our
physical bodies and experience. @Giddens:1984 uses the idea of *structuration*
to propose that agency and structure are mutually constitutive entities with
equal status, each of which recursively reproduces the other. The idea of
structuration has already seen some purchase in the field of archival studies
where it has been used for understanding appraisal [@Brown:1991], descriptive
practices [@Yakel:2003], the space/time dimensions of records [@Upward:1996 ;
@Upward:1997], and the use of collaborative documentation networks.

Similarly @Bourdieu:1977's idea of *habitus* identifies the site of our lived
experience which is shaped by social structures, which generate individual
action. @Schwartz:1995 mobilizes Bourdieu when analyzing how archival
photographs function as documents that both produce, and are the product of,
social rules. @Gracy:2007 has also drawn on Bourdieu's notion of field, habitus
and social capital in researching how commercial and nonprofit film archives
operate. In some significant recent work @Ivanov:2017 conceptualizes archival
theory in terms of practice theory, and uses both as a framework for examining
record keeping practices in large news organizations.

At first it might seem strange to consider the physical body and its practices
in relation to something as seemingly immaterial as the web. But the web and the
underlying Internet are physical infrastructures that constantly generate
records as we point and click in our browsers, swipe the screens of our
smartphones, as we are quietly surveilled by the Internet of Things
[@Acker:2016]. Archives of web content sediment on servers as we document our
lives using record *making* technologies such as Facebook Live, which aren't
always record *keeping* technologies [@Sheffield:2018]. Given this orientation
towards practice and the general theoretical umbrella provide by Science and
Technology Studies I will conclude by suggesting several promising areas for for
future research into appraisal and web archives.

### II.C.1. Ethnography of Infrastructure

The ethnographic study of infrastructures in terms of the human practices that
play out in their construction and use is well developed in information studies
[@Suchman:1986 ; @Star:1999 ; @Bowker:2005]. For example @Edwards:2011a has
examined how metadata practices work to shape knowledge production in the
sciences. The mutually constitutive roles of policy, practice and design can
shape infrastructures and define the controversies that surround them
[@Jackson:2014c]. Social media applications like blogs have been studied for
their role in shaping scholarly communication infrastructure [@Burton:2015]. The
*convivial decay* of space science infrastructure has been investigated by
@Cohn:2016, who found that notions of repair, aging and multiple intersecting
life stories of people & machines played a significant role in how
infrastructure is designed, deployed, used and then dismantled. @Karasti:2018
propose a methodological framework anchored in STS and anthropology for
analyzing infrastructures over long time scales, that we see evidenced in the
work of @Ribes:2009 on the *long now* of infrastructures.

The ethnographic study of web archiving infrastructure in particular has also
begun, but more work remains. @Ogden:2017 provides a rare glimpse at how labor
and infrastructure intersect in the practices of web archivists at the Internet
Archive. Similarly @Kosnik:2016 has performed a detailed ethnography of archival
practices in fan fiction communities on the web. This recent work connecting web
infrastructure, archives, and social practices suggests further ethnographic
investigations of how web archives both shape and are shaped by ideas of
appraisal, or what is deemed valuable in the web.

### II.C.2. Repair and Maintenance

The turn to practice in Human and Computer Interaction (HCI) has been noted by
@Kuutti:2014, who suggests that HCI's focus on user needs, or macro-level
organizational systems are no longer sufficient for understanding the complex
formations of users and systems we see today in digital environments. The study
of computer systems in terms of practice offers a way of collapsing these
scales. Kuutti points out that the turn to practice in HCI research takes shape
around issues of performativity of social practices, materiality of human bodies
and artifacts, agency, and knowledge generation.

The role of repair as a site for design, in contrast to more conventional and
celebratory notions of innovation, is detailed in ethnographic work by
@Jackson:2014a, @DiSalvo:2010, @Rosner:2014 and @Maestri:2011. *Broken world
thinking* [@Jackson:2014] specifically recognizes that design happens not only
in the experimental setting of HCI research, but in our everyday lives as we
learn to adapt and improvise solutions to conceptual and infrastructural
breakdowns. Repair and breakdown are seen as two sides of the same coin of
maintenance. @Russell:2018 situate maintenance studies in terms of the history
of technology, where the investigation of how standards are developed can help
make sociotechnical assemblages legible [@Russell:2014 ; @Lampland:2009].

With the maintenance perspective in mind it is possible to broaden the scope of
what appraisal means in web archiving systems to include not only the design and
use of web archiving systems, but also the material practices and labor that
sustain the web, as software is upgraded, vendor contracts are abandoned and
content is ported from one system to another. Tracking these processes of data
migration as appraisal decisions in web archives is a viable and under explored
avenue for archival studies research, particularly in connection with
postcustodial theories of the archive.

@Hedstrom:2002 suggests that the archivist's appraisal decisions are an
essential part of the archive's *interface* with the past, found both on the
screen, and embodied in the archivist. In some recent work @Maemura:2018 has
begun to explore how archival decisions manifest in the provenance of web
archival systems, in terms of the documentation they provide and the
sociotechnical means by which that documentation is generated and conveyed.
Further surfacing the repair work of archivists, and the web as a site for
continual repair and maintenance is a key area for future research into archival
appraisal on the web.

### II.C.3. Software Studies

The field of software studies provides a humanistic method for reading software
and digital media systems as artifacts, with particular material, social and
historical dimensions. For example, @Manovich:1999 has studied the database as a
narrative form whose ontology structures the cultural artifacts that it helps
generate. @Kelty:2008's pioneering ethnographic work has helped us understand
open source software development communities as a *recursive public* that uses
the infrastructure of the web and the Internet to develop and express what the
Internet is, or can be.

Another class of research that fits (perhaps a bit less comfortably) under the
rubric of software studies is work that explores the materiality of digital
media in terms of inscription [@Kittler:1999], memory [@Chun:2011], digital
storage and transmission [@Kirschenbaum:2008], protocols [@Galloway:2004],
physical networks [@Starosielski:2015], documents [@Levy:2001 ; @Gitelman:2014],
data representation [@Dourish:2017] and even archives [@Ernst:2013]. In this
varied literature there is a consistent engagement with how data systems are
anything but neutral [@Bowker:2005 ; @Gitelman:2013 ; @Walford:2017], and are
configured by the material that they are constructed from, and by the design
decisions of their creators and maintainers.

One relevant area for understanding appraisal in web archives is the growing
fields of platform and algorithm studies, which are closely aligned, but operate
from different levels of abstraction and granularity. Platform and  algorithm
studies examine the social, political and cultural contingencies that the
technologies provided by organizations like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia
coproduce with their publics and users. At the platform scale these
contingencies manifest in established policies such as moderation rules,
community guidelines, and terms of service documents, which are translated into
actual practices, and in turn generate political economies [@Gillespie:2010 ;
@Gillespie:2018]. Similarly algorithm studies, despite its usual association
with computer science, provides a humanistic lens for studying the development,
use and impact of computation in particular settings, enabled by specific
practices, in order to achieve explicit or tacit ends [@Gillespie:2015 ;
@Seaver:2017]. As such platform and algorithm studies fit within the scope of
critical data studies [@boyd:2012], which shifts the focus from policy and code
to flows and accumulations of data, and their politics [@Zuboff:2015 ;
@Bratton:2016].

As noted by @Dourish:2017, it's awkward, and perhaps a bit misleading, to lump
all these theoretical concerns into the category of *software studies*. However
doing so, is a convenience that allow us to talk about the possible avenues of
future research for web archives, especially with respect to appraisal. At the
risk of introducing yet another category, @Kitchin:2014a draws on STS
terminology to mobilize the idea of *data assemblages*, which are heterogeneous,
sociotechnical constructs that resemble Foucault's *dispotifs* that act as
bundles of "discourses, institutions, architectural forms, regulatory decisions,
laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical, moral and
philanthropic propositions" [quoted in @Kitchin:2014a]. Kitchin suggests several
methods for studying the complex phenomena that are data assemblages:

1. examining code artifacts, their data inputs and outputs as time bound processes
2. reflecting on the writing & design of code, heuristics and algorithms
3. reverse engineering algorithms, to intuit processes and architectures that are hidden from view
4. conduct ethnographies of design teams to ascertain the contingent, relational, and contextual way software is produced
5. widening the ethnographic lens to consider institutional and organizational forces at work
6. widening the ethnographic lens yet again to consider the work that the algorithmic systems do in the world, either intended or unintended, and their social and historical significance

In some significant recent work @BenDavid:2018 used techniques from the study of
*black box* algorithms (algorithms whose inner workings are secret, or so
complex that they are unknowable) [@Diakopoulos:2014] to consider the epistemic
role of web archives as fact or evidence producing systems. Ben-David
specifically looks at the representation of the the North Korean top-level
domain (.kp) in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, using traces of
provenance information provided by the Wayback Machine's interface, in
combination with the historical contingencies of DNS leak that occurred in 2016.
Ben-David finds that the Wayback Machine's processes for acquiring data from the
web are found to be iterative, top-down, bottom-up, and that they extend
laterally outside of the Internet Archive organizational walls.

Similarly @Schafer:2016 employs techniques from STS to unpack the sociotechnical
black-boxes of web archive infrastructure to stress the importance of web
archives for Internet governance. Both pieces highlight how the quiet labor of
web archives, performed by archivists in collaboration with, and sometimes in
spite of, machines, are of historical and political significance. More work
remains for understanding the technological, social and historical contexts in
how these software systems, standards and organizations have
developed--particularly with regards to our understanding of what a web archive
is, what it is not, and how the difference is negotiated. The time is ripe for
these analyses since we have 30 years of web, and 20 years of web archiving
practice to study.

### II.C.4. Data Justice

And finally, a significant strand of work in the turn to practice has drawn
attention to how the design of information systems can respond to the needs of
social justice. The imperative for technology to be designed by those who are
supposed to ultimately use it was initially developed in the 1960s in
Scandinavia, and gave rise to the field of participatory or cooperative design,
which has garnered sustained interest from the HCI and Computer Supported
Cooperative Work research communities [@Suchman:1986 ; @Ehn:1988 ; @Star:1996 ;
@Kensing:1998]. Related concepts such as Communities of Practice [@Lave:1991]
provide a rich methodological framework for understanding how social practices
involving technology constitute the way we learn and work together in
sustainable ways. Furthermore, the role of information technology
infrastructures in measuring and making legible environmental change
[@Edwards:2010 ; @Jackson:2014d] while also negatively impacting local and
global environments [@Cubitt:2016] is an increasingly important area of concern.
Indeed, the general thesis that there is no escaping the politics that are
embedded in our technologies is a theme that is returned to again and again
[@Winner:1980]. More recent recent work has explored how data infrastructures
are both the product of, and can give rise to capacity building for mobilizing
change [@Tufekci:2017 ; @Meng:2018]. This work uses an ethnographic approach to
consider how data practices are part of a constellation of other social and
political practices.

This research literature bundled under the theme of social justice in
information technology intersects broadly with archival studies in significant
ways. As noted by @Punzalan:2016, archives and memory studies have been
perennially interested in the role of social justice. These researchers have
worked to dispel the notion that archives are neutral in their representation of
communities or society as a whole, and that they necessarily embody particular
social and political values. Specifically the goals of community archives
[@Flinn:2011] and participation in archival processes of appraisal and
description have been marshaled from a variety of angles [@Gilliland:2014 ;
@Huvila:2015] that mirror the goals of participatory design.

In terms of addressing web archives, and specifically the needs of archival
appraisal, there has been some emerging work, but much remains. @Goldman:2018
has begun studying how digital preservation frameworks such as the Open Archives
Information System (OAIS), and principles such as Lots Of Copies Keeps Stuff
Safe (LOCKSS), can introduce overheads that negatively impact the environment,
and if widely practiced, could undermine the long-term sustainability of data
archives. @Christen:2017 has explored how values expressed in open access
licenses and metadata standards can be at cross purposes with the ethical
curation and access to cultural heritage materials. These risks can be mitigated
by engagement with local communities and community archives practices.
Furthermore, in the wake of the 2016 US Presidential Election the Environmental
Data Governance Initiative worked to preserve at risk data sets produced by the
Environmental Protection Agency and other US federal agencies. This work was
articulated as a web archiving project, and was performed by volunteer
archivists, librarians, technologists, scientists and concerned citizens
[@Schlanger:2017]. Participants have reflected on how this *data justice* work
fits into an evidence based accountability framework [@Dillon:2017]. But
understanding how these and other emerging data justice projects [@Taylor:2017]
take place both in and through the infrastructure of the web, and express
implicit or explicit appraisal decision is work that remains.

## II.D. Appraisal 

My review has drawn from the archival studies, digital library and
sociotechnical research literatures in order to highlight the gap in our
understanding of web archival appraisal as a sociotechnical practice. The
reasons for this gap are the result of a general lack of empirical studies of
how materials are selected for web archives, where the focus isn't so much on
the social practices or the technical practices, but on the diverse set of
interactions that occur when they are blended. Foucault's theory of
governmentality, or the conduct of conduct, bridges this conceptual terrain, and
offers a way of studying appraisal in web archives that aligns with current
notions of critical algorithm studies and critical data studies. Providing an
empirical study of how web archives are constructed is the principal goal of
this dissertation. It is in the analysis of material working practices in web
archives where appraisal values can be identified and theorized.
