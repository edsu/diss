Something from Knuth?

Knotty Pine / David Byrne lyrics sung by him & Dirty Projectors.

Here is the sound that photographs make
When I see them
When I hear them

I see regions of sharp precision
Over abundance
Over indulgence

Tied together with rope and twine
Stuck together with paste and glue
Two old planks of knotty pine
And a couple of nails poked right on through
