### Recruitment Letter

Dear ___________

My name is Ed Summers, and I am a researcher from the College for Information
Studies at the University of Maryland. I am spending a year working with the
National Software Reference Library as part of NIST's Professional Research
Experience Program (PREP). During this time I'm investigating the social and
technical factors that help shape the construction of digital archives, in
particular the content that they collect.

Given that the NSRL is a unique and long running example of a digital archive I
was hoping to speak with you about your experience working in or with the NSRL.
Hearing more about the types of work you do, and how you think about the
activities of the NSRL would be extremely helpful to me as I conduct this
research project.

All interview materials (transcripts and recordings) will be kept confidential.
If you would rather not be named as a participant you can choose a pseudonym
that will be used in all research materials. In addition if any quotations from
the interview that are used in published materials they will be sent to you
beforehand for clarification and approval. I expect the interview to last no
longer than one hour. I hope we can find a time to talk.


Sincerely,

Ed Summers
