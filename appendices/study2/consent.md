### Consent Form

#### Project Title

Enacting Appraisal: Investigating the sociotechnical factors of software selection in the NSRL.

#### Purpose of the Study

This research is being conducted by d Summers at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am inviting you to participate in this research project because you have worked to help build and/or sustain the National Software Reference Library.  The purpose of this research project is to better understand how decisions are made about how to build digital collections, particularly when they involve obtaining content from the web.

#### Procedures

The procedure involves an unstructured interview with you which will be audio recorded and transcribed.  Interviews will take between 60 and 90 minutes. If you wish you can choose a pseudonym that will be used in place of your name in all written materials.  Content analysis performed on the transcripts will be used to derive emergent themes and issues that speak to the study's research question. There are no direct benefits to participants.

#### Potential Risks

There is no more than minimal risk associated with participating in this study. However, every potential subject will have the option to refrain from participation.  Additionally, all participants will be asked if they would like me to use a pseudonym instead of their name in order to protect their identities and minimize risk.

#### Potential Benefits

There are no direct benefits to you. However, the goal of this study is to understand how content selection processes and technical infrastructures have coevolved in the NSRL. This may or may not be of interest to your work in or with the NSRL.

#### Confidentiality

Any potential loss of confidentiality will be minimized by storing data in encrypted form in a private DropBox folder which will only be accessible by researchers. If I write a report or article about this research project, your identity will be protected to the maximum extent possible. I will also notify you before hand if I plan to use any quotes from your interview to give you an opportunity to clarify, or if you would prefer me not to use the quote. 

Your information may be shared with representatives of the University of Maryland, College Park or governmental authorities if you or someone else is in danger or if we are required to do so by law. If participants wish their interviews can be donated back to the NSRL as historical documents.
