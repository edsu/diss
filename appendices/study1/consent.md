### Consent Form

You are invited to be in a research study that explores the selection of Web
content for preservation in an archive. You were selected as a possible
participant because you have some expertise in either the selection of Web
content for archival processing or the design of tools to assist in the
archiving of Web content. I hope to interview you on these subjects.

Interviewing will possibly occur with real-time computer and code referencing,
this is the considered the "observation" element of this study.  Please feel
free to ask me any questions before participating. Being in the study is
voluntary and you are free to stop at any time. Refusing to be in the study or
stopping study activity will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you
are otherwise entitled.

The purpose of this document is to give you the information you will need to
help you decide whether to be in the study or not.  Please read the form
carefully.  You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what I
would ask you to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a
volunteer, and anything else about the research or this form that is not clear. 
When I have answered all your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the
study or not.  This process is called "informed consent."  I will give you a
copy of this form for your records.

#### Background

This study is being conducted by Ed Summers in the College of Information
Studies at the University of Maryland. Its purpose is to explore the current
processes and tools used to select content from the Web for archiving. If you
agree to be in this study, I ask your permission to a conduct face to face
semi-structured interview.

Your decision on whether to participate will not affect your current or future
relations with the University of Maryland or your current employer, and you may
withdraw at any time without affecting those relationships.  The face to face
interview usually takes no more than 1 hour, and there is no compensation for
participating in the face to face interview. The observation component of this
study may be part of the interview and is included in this 1 hour time period.
I envision this as an active interview that possibly involves looking at Web
content together, talking about Web archiving work, and looking online for
examples to discuss.

The audio/video recordings will be transcribed and then coded to identify
patterns and strategies for selecting Web content for archiving.

#### Risks

There is no physical or medical component to this research, and there is no risk
of physical injury. The identities and organizational membership of the 
interviewees will not be revealed in our published findings, and a pseudonym 
will be used.

#### Benefits

There may be no benefits to you personally for participating in the current
research; however, there may be some professional and societal benefits. This
study will help the archival community better understand the processes by which
Web content is selected for an archive. Currently very little research into this
phase of the work of Web archiving has been done. The hope is that the findings
of this study will help influence the design of tools that assist archivists in
their work.

#### Confidentiality

Confidentiality will be maintained by a) aggregating information and b) by
assigning pseudonyms.  I have an ethical and legal obligation to protect
confidential information used or obtained in the course of research and all
policies on confidentiality apply equally to data stored both in the computer
and on paper records.  Any non-disclosure agreements to which you are a party
will be respected and maintained by the security of aggregation and pseudonyms.

Confidentiality will be maintained by aggregating information in tables and
graphs that describe broad trends in attitudes and demographics across the
population. Composite descriptive sketches will not refer to the data collected
from named individuals.
	
Confidentiality will be maintained by assigning you a pseudonym.  Any taped
conversations, paper notes, or other research materials associated with our
exchanges will be identified with the pseudonym.  The only code sheet
identifying you with your pseudonym will be kept in locked storage over a mile
away from the research materials. This code sheet will be destroyed at the end
of the study, or by the end of 2016.

If any published material is going to include a quotation from the transcript I
will notify you via email and request your approval. If I don't hear anything
back in two weeks I will resend the notification. If there is no response I will
publish the quotation. I will respect your wishes to either not include the 
quotation, or to provide clarification.

#### Contacts

You will be given a copy of this form to keep for your records, and you may ask
any questions you have now.  If you have questions later, you may contact me by
telephone at +1 (240) 478-7086 or by email at edsu@umd.edu.
