### IX.A.2. Recruitment Letter

Dear {Name}

I am a researcher at the University of Maryland, and I am investigating the
appraisal process in Web archives. I am interested in interviewing you
regarding your expertise in this matter and attached to this email is the
formal interview request. If you agree the interview will last no longer than 1
hour. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you might have.

You were selected as a possible participant because you have some expertise 
in either selecting Web content for an archive, or in building tools/services 
that facilitate the selection process.

I will be conducting the interviews via Skype and recording the audio and video.
This is considered the "observation" element of this study. In the analysis
phase of the study I will personally be creating transcripts, and performing
open coding on them for theory building about the Web appraisal process. Your
name and your institution will not be mentioned in any published material from
these transcripts.

I hope you volunteer to take part in this study. Please contact me if you are
interested in participating or would like to ask me any questions about it.  If
you do not contact me, I will follow up with you once and then assume that not
hearing from you means you are not interested in participating. Please note that
communication sent via e-mail cannot be guaranteed confidential.

Please find attached an information statement with additional information on
the interview procedure.

Sincerely,

Ed Summers
