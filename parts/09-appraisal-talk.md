# 5. Appraisal Talk in Web Archives

Archival appraisal is generally understood to be the work that archivists do to
identify materials that have sufficient enduring value to justify their being
cared for in an archives [@Pearce:2005a]. It is typical for archives to have
different notions of value, and these are often expressed in the collection
development policies that archivists use in the selection work they do while
processing collections. Appraisal decisions continue to be made as collections
are cared for and as the demands of new records impinge on the archive’s ability
to store them [@Rapport:1981].

While the values ascribed to individual archives differ, the activity of
appraisal is central to the work of all archivists. The cumulative effect of
these appraisal decisions shapes the historical record and, by extension, our
knowledge about the past and our social memory [@Jacobsen:2013]. This
value-driven process of appraisal has many facets, which sometimes can seem to
suffuse all of the archivist’s work. For example, the values that drive
appraisal also find expression in the ways archives are arranged and described,
which in turn determine how they are accessed [@Yakel:2003]. To describe this
moment at the inception of an archive with more specificity, Eric Ketelaar
coined the term *archivalization*:

> It is archivalization , a neologism which I invented, meaning the conscious or
> unconscious choice (determined by social and cultural factors) to consider
> something worth archiving. Archivalization precedes archiving. The searchlight
> of archivalization has to sweep the world for something to light up in the
> archival sense, before we proceed to register, to record, to inscribe it, in
> short before we archive it. [@Ketelaar:2001]

The searchlight of archivalization that Ketelaar imagines for us is the process
of deciding what to remember, no matter what material form the archive takes. In
this chapter, I use _archivalization_ and _appraisal_ somewhat interchangeably,
but I use _archivalization_ to refer specifically to the initial moments in
which a decision is made about what to preserve and what not to preserve.
Ketelaar goes on to remind us that "technology changes the archivable". The
technologies of record production that we create inevitably shape both _what_
and _how_ records get archived [@Schwartz:1995].

In this chapter I will explore how these expressions of archivalization, the
specific moments of appraisal, are being performed in web archives in order to
gain insight into how the infrastructure of the Web is shaping our attempts to
preserve it. In order to investigate these moments of archivalization, I will
use critical discourse analysis to closely examine how web archivists talk about
their appraisal decisions. As my findings illustrate the global address space of
the Web and the immediacy of its underlying protocols have occasioned a shift in
the nature of appraisal, particularly with regard to the trust relationship
between the documenter and the documented.

## 5.1. Methodology

One way of investigating the phenomenon of archivalization is to qualitatively
analyze how archivists talk about their appraisal work: to look at the words
they use, the conventions they have established, the context they share, the
ways they learn from each other in communities of practice, and the political
work that these communicative practices perform [@Wenger:1998]. To address these
research objectives, I undertook a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of a set of
ethnographic interviews of individuals involved in selecting web content for
archives. I employed CDA because it offers a theoretical framework, grounded in
critical theory, for analyzing the way in which participants’ use of language
reflects identity formation, figured worlds, and social relations, while also
addressing the larger socio-cultural context in which practice takes place. CDA
helps to examine how language use connects with issues of ideology and power,
which are particularly relevant when considering archival appraisal as an
inherently political act, in line with a critical archival studies’ perspective
[@Caswell:2017].

Sociolinguist James Paul Gee, a practitioner and theorist of CDA, noted that
"there are solid linguistic, even grammatical grounds, on which to argue that
all language-in-interaction is inherently political" [@Gee:2011a]. Indeed, CDA
is a theoretical approach to language use rather than a method as such, and
those who practice CDA bring a variety of discourse analysis methods to bear in
their analyses [@Wodak:2001]. Gee’s research centers on the fields of education,
literacy, and media studies. This focus makes his work particularly relevant for
analyzing the ways archivists talk about web archives. He elucidates *seven
building tasks* that language performs to reflect and produce social relations.
These building tasks involve [@Gee:2014, pp. 95-98]:

1. **significance**: how language is used to foreground and background certain things
2. **activities**: how language is used to enact particular activities
3. **identity**: how language is used to position specific identities and make them recognizable
4. **relationships**: how language is used to construct relationships between people and things;
5. **politics**: how notions of value and norms are established in the use of language;
6. **connections**: how language is used to connect and disconnect ideas, activities, and objects; and
7. **sign systems and knowledge**: how language positions particular sign systems, or ways of knowing and believing.^56

Gee also provides a set of methodological tools that support the analysis of
linguistic performances, or building tasks – in other words, tools that are used
to dissect the ways that language produces social relations. For Gee, words do
actual work in the world: "Whenever we speak or write, we always and
simultaneously build one of seven things or seven areas of 'reality'"
[@Gee:2014, p. 94]. While I draw on several of Gee’s building tasks and tools in
my analysis, as I immersed myself in my transcription data, I became
particularly focused on the building tasks related to *relationships*,
*identity*, and *politics*.

While language is important, it is not the only means by which archivists build
community in their work. CDA also allows the researcher to examine language use
in relation to non-linguistic elements such as technology, infrastructure, and
setting. Although this study focuses specifically on linguistic discourse,
software utilities, infrastructures, and the geographic dispersion of Internet
communication provide important dimensions for understanding the work of
appraisal in web archives. Some of these factors emerge below in the discussion
of the results. In the table below I have included a brief glossary of some
notation that is used in the transcripts included here:


| Notation  | Meaning                                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------|
| //        | Final intonation contour, like a period in writing             |
| /         | Non-final intonation contour, like a comma                     |
| [segment] | Overlapping talk                                               |
| =         | Latching: two utterances that follow one another without pause |
| WORD      | An emphasized or stressed word

In addition to Gee’s seven building tasks, I used several of his specific tools
for discourse analysis; these are mentioned in the context of the findings they
helped illuminate.^62

## 5.2. Findings

The findings draw from interviews with three subjects, who I refer to using the
pseudonyms Jim, Jack, and Carly. These excerpts, from the 30 hours of interviews
coded for analysis, have been selected specifically because of the way these
informants talked about their appraisal work and the manner in which they
involved other people in their decision-making processes. Gee’s seven building
tasks, which allow language users to shape social realities, were chosen to
provide a framework for insights into how and why appraisal in web archives is
being performed – not to quantify or otherwise make generalized claims about the
practice as a whole.

As I performed close readings of the transcripts, Gee’s building task related to
relationships appeared particularly useful for examining the participants’ use
of language. Gee explains this building task by associating it with his
relationships building tool, which is used to analyze relationships found in
language:

> For any communication, ask how words and various grammatical devices are being
> used to build and sustain or change relationships of various sorts among the
> speaker, other people, social groups, cultures and/or institutions.
> [@Gee:2014a, p. 121]

Focusing on relationships present in the archivists’ use of language in turn
exposed two more of Gee’s building tasks: those related to identities and
politics. Regarding identities, Gee advises researchers to ask "what socially
recognizable identity or identities the speaker is trying to enact or to get
others to recognize" [@Gee:2014a, p. 116]. Regarding politics, Gee is primarily
concerned with how language performs the distribution of "social goods" or
enacts day-to-day politics rather than with formal systems of government. The
discussion of the findings below is organized around three themes that emerged
when using the questions Gee suggests in relation to these three building tasks:
the themes of hierarchies, mentorship, and structures.

The excerpts included below are not typical quotations because they aim to
capture the stresses, pauses, and rhythms of speech using the aforementioned
notation. The lines are sparse, numbered, and spatially organized to reflect the
individual utterances that form the recognizable speech units that will be
analyzed. The length of the excerpts varies depending on the amount of context
that is useful for the discussion. The excerpts used here are not intended to be
representative of archivists in general but are used to provide insights into
particular factors that are at play in the appraisal of web content.

### 5.2.1. Hierarchies

Jim works as an archivist in a non-profit organization that does a large amount
of web archiving as well as digitization. In the following excerpt, Jim
describes a situation where a large amount of data was being archived from a
video streaming provider that was going out of business. I was asking Jim to
recall a time when he had needed to make a decision about whether or not to
archive a particular website or document. The excerpt provides a particularly
salient snapshot of the type of discussion that goes on in his organization when
archivists decide how to archive a large amount of content from the Web:

|   11 |          | and Ariana initially will go /                 |
|   12 |          | "Why? /                                        |

|   22 |          | or if we could potentially be facing some kind of issue with it / |
|   23 |          | let’s go have a chat with Greg" /              |
|   24 |          | and now it’s me and Greg and Ariana saying /   |
|   25 |          | "Are we gonna do this?" //                     |
|   26 | Ed       | mm-hmm                                         |
|   27 | Jim      | Now when I mention these /                     |
|   28 |          | I mention them like it’s some sort of whatever / |
|   29 |          | you know we’re talking /                       |
|   30 |          | I’d have to say that that’s me and Greg and Ariana going / |
|   31 |          | whether this job /                             |
|   32 |          | has happened like /                            |
|   33 |          | six times in the last three years /            |
|   34 | Ed       | mmm                                            |
|   35 | Jim      | maybe? /                                       |
|   36 |          | Ooom [and Ariana]                              |
|   37 | Ed       | [and did] /                                    |
|   38 |          | was Real TV /                                  |
|   39 |          | was this one of the examples? /                |
|   40 |          | the Real TV one or?                            |
|   41 | Jim      | Well Greg helped me get in contact with the employees / |
|   42 |          | Greg was already on the ground with it.        |
|   43 | Ed       | Oh okay //                                     |
|   44 | Jim      | and Greg /                                     |
|   45 |          | KNEW /                                         |
|   46 |          | that it was going to be a lot of data /        |
|   47 |          | and was like /                                 |
|   48 |          | "Okay so [be a little more] /                  |
|   49 | Ed       | [ahhhh]                                        |
|   50 | Jim      | careful with this"                             |

As I asked Jim to recall a specific occasion when he had needed to make an
appraisal decision, he recalled a situation that emphasized relationships with
other employees in his organization. Note the use in line 3 of "higher ups,"
which invokes the concept of an organizational hierarchy or chain of command
that involved his manager, Ariana, and Greg, the director of the archives. These
relationships are foregrounded and frame the decision that is being made.
Invoking the organizational hierarchy in this manner lends weight and formality
to the appraisal decision, while also working to lead us away from a discussion
of the appraisal criteria. The moment of archivalization is surfaced and then
effaced. Just as the hierarchy is emphasized, the details of the actual
decision-making process are elided with rapid speech and the use of "this this"
in line 15 to refer to the actual appraisal criteria. We do not actually know
what Jim says to Ariana to persuade her that the video content is worth saving:
the "this" references are stressed through repetition, but they both lack a
referent. Jim indicates that these conversations are infrequent and that the
initial decision to archive this content came directly from Greg. The decision
to archive this content started at the top, came down, and then went back to the
top of this appraisal ladder again. The circularity and vagueness of these
hierarchical relationships suggests that they could be operating as a rhetorical
device to formalize what is otherwise a much less structured and more organic
process. One additional relationship that is identified only near the end of
this segment is the connection between Greg and Jim, inside the archives, and an
employee outside at the video streaming organization. Archives often refer to
these connections as donor relationships, because they broker communications
between individuals or organizations that are donating materials and the
receiving archives. Greg is described as helping Jim contact an employee and as
already being "on the ground" with the process, which casts the archives in the
role of actively seeking content and not simply receiving content. This is a
highly significant donor relationship, which we will return to below.

### 5.2.2. Mentorship

Jack is an archivist at a large university in the United States, which he joined
a few years ago after leaving a previous job as an archivist at another
university. In this segment, Jack describes how he came to work on a web archive
that documents the activities of the fracking industry.

| Line | Speaker  | Utterance                                      | 
| ----:| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
|    1 | Jack     | I came to University A actually wanting to /   |
|    2 |          | to drive some more um /                        |
|    3 |          | I guess professional engagement around the legacy of fracking in this state // |
|    4 |          | I came from the University B where /           |
|    5 |          | we had a lot of really intense collections around environmentalism / |
|    6 |          | and energy development in the state /          |
|    7 |          | and it was a sort of an area of programming for the archives there // |
|    8 |          | And one of my close colleagues there had done a project / |
|    9 |          | basically sort of like anticipating the next energy boom in the state / |
|   10 |          | which coincidentally was fracking //           |
|   11 |          | which also coincidentally was um something that 30 or 40 years ago / |
|   12 |          | a company wanted to um /                       |
|   13 |          | explore by /                                   |
|   14 |          | detonating a series of underground nuclear explosions to |
|   15 |          | stimulate the gas um /                         |
|   16 |          | to the surface [chuckle] //                    |
|   17 | Ed       | Whaaat?                                        |
|   18 | Jack     | And we had some collections on on that /       |
|   19 |          | sort of like the protest effort that um /      |
|   20 |          | that killed that endeavour //                  |
|   21 |          | So she had done just a lot of really interesting stuff= |
|   22 |          | oral histories exploring the boom and bust and / |
|   23 |          | so I always kind of had in the back of my mind that coming / |
|   24 |          | to University A /                              |
|   25 |          | I had other reasons for coming /               |
|   26 |          | but that in coming here                        |
|   27 |          | this was an issue I wanted to explore //       |
|   28 |          | But I didn’t really have an opportunity to push it / |
|   29 |          | until I saw / some news announcement somewhere / |
|   30 |          | I don’t know where /                           |
|   31 |          | but University C announcing that they were /   |
|   32 |          | going to start this project /                  |
|   33 |          | to document the fracking anti-fracking activism in the state // |
|   34 |          | And I immediately took it to our associate dean / |
|   35 |          | who at the time was Mark Dalton //             |

Again, we see that relationships figure prominently in this description of how
decisions are made about what to archive from the Web. In lines 34–35, a
hierarchical relationship between Jack and Mark is positioned as one of the key
moments of appraisal, as we saw in the previous example. We also see several
organizational relationships traced between Jack’s current university (A), his
previous university (B), and an institutional collaborator (C). However, unlike
in the previous example, these are not hierarchical relationships but links of
influence and practice. The first relationship, between organization A and
organization B, is mediated by Jack’s own professional history. He worked at
both of these organizations and mentions them in order to highlight a specific
mentoring relationship between himself and a colleague at University B, who had
done significant archival work around documenting fracking. His description of
this relationship as "close" and as a source of inspiration lacks the clinical
tone used in descriptions of the previous hierarchical relationships. This
mentoring connection knits archival practices for oral histories together with
those for websites, using the shared interest in documenting environmental
issues and activism. There is also a relationship between Jack and an individual
at University C; their shared interest in documenting fracking activated Jack’s
ability to begin work on the collection and also became the seed of a
collaboration. It is important to note the implicit role that the Web plays in
this collaboration. The distributed, globally accessible information space of
the Web means that Jack and his collaborator at University C needed to partition
their work geographically. Unlike physical collections, which can be in only one
place at one time, the public Web is available to everyone who has a computer
and an Internet connection. Jack is not stymied by University C’s move to
document fracking but is emboldened to participate. While a request for approval
again moves up the organizational hierarchy, the initial impetus
(archivalization) comes laterally, from a peer at another institution, and from
the past in the form of his mentor. Rather than being a discrete event, the
moment of archivalization actually involves an assemblage of actors removed in
both time and space. In the following excerpt, we continue to look at mentoring
relationships as evidence of an emergent community of practice including
archivists and web archivists. In this segment, we hear from Carly, who explains
that she became involved in web archiving while working as an archivist for over
a decade at several large research universities, where she spent a significant
amount of time performing web archiving.

| Line | Speaker  | Utterance                                      | 
| ----:| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
|    1 | Carly    | Yeah, that’s kind of how I’ve always /         |
|    2 |          | Back in the day when I first started in GovDocs / |
|    3 |          | one of my mentors /                            |
|    4 |          | she was a local docs librarian at University D / |
|    5 |          | and her approach /                             |
|    6 |          | and I feel I would love to figure out a way to do this better / |
|    7 |          | So she actually just got the three major newspapers in the county area / |
|    8 |          | and she=we would pile them up for her /        |
|    9 |          | and she would just take like a day a week /    |
|   10 |          | and she would go through and CLIP /            |
|   11 |          | the news articles /                            |
|   12 |          | and then she would make sure she got /         |
|   13 |          | the documents that were mentioned um /         |

Here, Carly is connecting her practice in appraising web content with her
professional experience of working as a government documents librarian. Carly
specifically uses "one of my mentors" to emphasize that she learned from a
specific individual – and the plural form identifies this person as one of
several mentors she has learned from during her career. References to these
mentoring relationships suggest that archivalization draws on a network of
learning through a community of practice. Carly’s attention to specific details,
such as the "three major newspapers," how her mentor "would pile them up" – as
well as the stressed "clip" – recall the physical process of doing the work. The
confusion in subjects in the "she=we" points to Carly’s reconstruction of the
scene for this appraisal work and indicates that she was one of several people
working together as part of a team. It is also apparent from the repair in line
6 that Carly feels that this material process does not have a direct analogue in
her current web archiving work (even though she goes on to talk about her use of
email discussion lists, RSS feeds, and bookmarks later in the interview) and
that it could be useful to find one.


### 5.2.3. Structures

There is something else going on in Carly’s discourse, which may be apparent
only to an outsider to the library and archives profession. To draw this out, it
can be useful to follow the guidance in Gee’s making strange tool: "For any
communication, try to act as if you are an ‘outsider.’ Ask yourself: What would
someone (perhaps even a Martian) find strange here (unclear, confusing, worth
questioning) if that person did not share the knowledge and assumptions and make
the inferences that render the communication so natural and taken-for- granted
by insiders?" [@Gee:2014a, p. 19] Specifically, the reference to "getting
started in GovDocs" (line 2) and the expression "local docs librarian" (line 4)
speak to a particular type of work that is not necessarily directly tied to the
work of web archivists. Government documents librarians are trained librarians
who focus on collecting, preserving, and providing access to documents published
by federal, state, and local governments. This type of work came about in the
United States after the establishment of the Federal Depository Library Program
and the Government Printing Office by the *Printing Act of 1895*. As such, it is
highly regulated work that is guided by policy. The work of scanning the "three
major newspapers" and looking for references to "documents" was being done in
the context of this highly politicized activity. How were the major newspapers
selected, and what factors influenced their selection? What government documents
– material output of governmental activities that present a view of society from
the perspective of the state – were librarians looking for? This context for the
newspaper clipping and note taking is also the experience that guides Carly as
she decides what to archive from the Web. The scanning of newspapers for
references to government documents is a precise moment in the process of
archivalization. We see this same political aspect at work more explicitly in
this final excerpt from Jack, who is reflecting on his work to document
fracking.

Using Gee’s making strange tool again to uncover the context of this excerpt
draws our attention to the use of the phrases "crawling and selecting" (line 2)
and "scope out... sites to crawl" (line 12). "Crawling" refers to the behaviour
of software used to collect content from the Web. This software is tradition-
ally referred to as a _spider_ because it automatically and recursively follows
links in web content for an amount of time that is determined by the scope it
is given. However, the software needs to be told where to start crawling. Jack
sought advice from local domain experts (lines 10–11) in determining where the
software should begin crawling and for how long, but he also indicates that he
is planning to do more work with the activist communities he is documenting.
Jack reflects that activist communities may be concerned with how he has
selected content for the archive. He also significantly discusses credibility,
in lines 16–19, as a measure of what should (and should not) be in the archive.
The web archive is shown to be a contested political space. We also see several
relationships being teased out here: the relationship between Jack and other
members of the university community; the relationship between Jack and the
community of activists who are working to stop fracking in the state; the
relationship between Jack and the software that is performing the archiving
activity; and finally, the relationship between Jack and the interviewer
(myself) as I orient to his description of how the credibility of the fracking
archive had been called into question (line 18). The two communities, of
activists and of the university, are presented as being at odds; but elsewhere
in the interview, Jack talks about an overlap between them (university members
who are also activists like himself). Tracing this network of political agendas
and associations is tied up in the work of selecting which websites to archive
and is part of the figured world that Jack and I are building in this interview.
Doing the work of crawling the Web and appraising web content inscribes these
political dynamics into the archive and presents an opportunity to reflect on
what they are.

## 5.3. Discussion

Gee’s seven building tasks provided a clarifying lens for studying the discourse
that emerged from these interviews. Specifically, Gee’s relationships building
tool helped trace the connections between archivists, their colleagues, their
institutions, and the creators of web content out in the world. These
relationships mark pathways of mutual engagement and illuminate how appraisal
decisions, or acts of archivalization, are made as part of a community of
practice. Carly and Jack’s comments about mentoring relationships are of
particular interest because they present historical relationships that extended
in time, rather than relationships anchored in individual workplaces. Both
archivists drew on mentoring experiences when speaking about how they made
appraisal decisions. It is interesting that, in both cases, the experiences
involved not web archiving but the archiving of physical documents and oral
histories. The appraisal decisions were oriented around the purpose or function
of the archives as political agents rather than around the specifics of the Web
as a medium. The archivists engaged in translation work to map their experience
with archiving print material to help them make determinations about whether to
archive web content. The inherent political dimension to these relationships was
another feature that emerged from the discourse. Hierarchical relationships
within the organizations operated to buttress appraisal or validate appraisal
decisions, but we also saw significant relationships between the archivists and
the communities or individuals that were being documented. In Carly’s case, this
relationship was embedded in the professional discourse around government
documents work and the operations of government. In the United States,
government documents are produced within a legal framework where they are
considered part of public discourse and the public domain. In Jim and Jack’s
cases, there was an awareness of a need for more interaction with the creators
of the documents being archived. The role of the archivist in relation to those
being documented forms part of a complex terrain that the archivist must
navigate in doing web archiving work. The organizational and community
relationships intersected with each other to generate productive and
destabilizing effects. Developing practices archivists can follow as they go
about making these connections with content creators on the Web, or as Jack
says, getting more "contact and dialogue" with content creators, is marked as a
potential area for further methodological and design work, especially with
regard to establishing trust relationships on the Web [@Neal:2002 ;
@Gracy:2004].

The approach of tracing relationships, exhibited here, has much in common with
the methods offered by actor network theory (ANT) [@Law:2009], with the
important distinction that non-human actors are not part of this discussion. ANT
suggests that one way to extend or enrich this work would be to explore how
artifacts such as policies, software tools, standards, and services fit into
this network of relationships and how they figure into moments of translation in
the work of web archiving. In addition, the concept of a community of practice
provides guidance for mapping the interactions and practices of web archiving
work. Wenger describes a community of practice as a process of "negotiated
meaning" that is achieved through the participation of its members in some joint
enterprise. But participation is not the whole story; negotiated meaning is also
dependent on something Wenger calls _reification_ , which he describes as "the
process of giving form to our experience by producing objects that congeal this
experience into ‘thingness.’ In so doing we create points of focus around which
the negotiation of meaning becomes organized" [@Wenger:1998, p. 58]. Wenger’s
idea of reification and its role in building communities of practice suggest
that consideration of the artifacts of web archiving could enrich this picture
of the relationships involved in appraisal work in web archives. This move also
nicely parallels Gee’s inclusion of non-linguistic elements into the analytical
scope provided by CDA. Recall Carly’s memorable description of the work she did
with her mentor to pile up newspapers and clip articles that held hints or clues
about documents they needed to track down for the archive. Activities like this
are examples of a shared repertoire that knits together participative and
reifying elements of a community of practice. It is important to remember that
Carly felt that she lacked an analogue to this practice in her work with web
archives. Moving beyond the interview and into participant observation in the
context of a case study is one way of exploring this gap.

Considering the political and the material dimensions of appraisal talk suggests
that an architectural shift has taken place in the movement from archiving
physical media such as documents, photographs, and disks to archiving networked
resources such as web pages, websites, and web platforms. Physical media require
some form of hand-off, where an archives gains possession of material either
through donation or by some other means. This often entails significant work by
the archivist, who is often involved in the physical transfer of materials and
the negotiation of a deed of gift that serves as a contract between the archives
and the individual or organization that currently owns the material. The
architecture of the Web dissolves this traditional relationship because the
content can be immediately acquired using the Internet and the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Additionally, web archiving software allows materials
to be rapidly collected in bulk, often without any interaction with the
publisher or owner of the content. On the Web, the idea that records will be
transferred to the archives when they are no longer actively used no longer
applies because it is precisely at the moment when records are removed from the
Web that they become unavailable to the web archivist, at least with our current
set of tools and practices. This revolution in record transfer technologies
suggests an inversion of current web archiving practice and a realignment of
traditional donor relations, in which web publishers reach out to web archives
to have their websites collected prior to them being turned off. The way web
archivists talk about their appraisal processes shows that, despite their
relative isolation, they work within dynamic and distributed communities of
practice that are extensions of a longer trajectory of appraisal in archives.
And yet, at the same time, the architecture of the Web and its affordances for
access have disrupted the traditional relationship of trust between the donor
and the archives. Access to the appropriate tools grants the archivist the
ability to easily collect content for the archives with very little interaction
with the content owner. This means it is more important than ever to consider
the positionality of the archives in relation to the documented entity when
deciding what to archive on the Web [@Jimerson:2009]. It also suggests that
there are opportunities for bridging this gap by becoming participating members
of the communities we document, including them in our communities of practice,
and developing tools and strategies that help us establish these connections.

As Verne Harris indicates here, accountability is an ever-important dimension to
the work of an archives. But engagement in a community of practice that includes
content creators as dynamic and complex participants presents challenges for
the archivist who works with the Web. What are the pathways of trust in web
archives? How do we enact and map them? While these have been perennial
challenges for the archival community, they are placed into stark relief in web
archives because of the modes of acquisition that often involve the record
creator only minimally, if at all. Finally, echoing Emily Maemura's point about
the importance of documenting provenance in web archives, we must recognize
these moments of archivalization as necessary elements of archival practice on
the Web [@Maemura:2018]. Yet, while provenance looks backwards in time to
reconstruct relationships between records and the world, appraisal looks
forwards to actively construct them. Appraisal in web archives is charged with
an architectural tension, as the Web’s access protocols and global namespace
collapse expected relations between archivists and records creators. The next
step for researchers and archivists working in and with web archives must be to
examine how current tools and practices can mend this architectural divide and
to establish a social web of trust that determines how a particular set of
records ends up in a web archives.
