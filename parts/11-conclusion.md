# 7. A Conclusion

The last three chapters have described how appraisal practices in web archives
are a rich and multifaceted practice. In Chapter 4 we saw how appraisal work is
fundamentally sociotechnical. In appraising content archival practitioners must
direct the use of automated tools that do the work of selecting and retrieving
content from the web. But they also engage in significant improvisational work
to make these tools, which are optimized for algorithmic data collection, fit
their ideas of appraisal as a legible and collaborative activity. In Chapter 5
we saw how the architecture of the web disrupts the relationship of trust
between records creators and archives, which is a central feature of appraisal.
However, archivists continue to work in a vibrant community of practice, where
this rupture in trust can be mended with more attention to the accountability
and positionality of web archives. Finally, in Chapter 6, I unpacked how the
values inherent in appraisal are dependent on the twinned phenomena of use and
legibility, which operate as an expression of governmentality.

I set out in the beginning using method-triangulation to generate a thick
description of appraisal practices in web archives. In that regard I think this
project has been successful. But the goal in creating this description was to
*zoom in* from what is talked about (themes), to how it is talked about
(discourse), to what actually happens (ethnography), in order to zoom back out
again, and draw some conclusions. The problem with thick description is that the
resulting description is, well, thick: it's dense, knotted and difficult to
untangle. This makes zooming out from all the details difficult. Despite the
difficulty, I will conclude with few observations of how these three studies
hang together, and what they say about appraisal in web archives.

One way of synthesizing the findings in these studies is to reflect on the key
controversies that I encountered while conducting them. By controversies I don't
mean specific events that were found in my data or findings. Instead I'm
interested in my own conceptual crises; where what I learned or experienced
challenged hidden assumptions of what appraisal in web archives is. Were there
hidden givens, or unstated axioms of appraisal that I had at the beginning of my
project which my findings compelled me to reevaluate? Fortunately the answer is
yes, and that they fell roughly into the categories: time, ontology, and use.

Recall the focus on *seed lists* in Chapter 4. I treated seed lists as singular
artifacts that recorded appraisal decisions about web content. Seed lists are
instructions for software to collect particular websites. In my interviews I
chose to ask participants about how URLs were added to their seed lists thinking
that this would give me access to their thinking about appraisal decisions.
Similarly, the analysis in Chapter 5 was geared towards drilling down into the
moments of *archivalization* in which the searchlight of appraisal was
manifested in decisions to archive one thing instead of another. Somewhere in
the middle of my NIST field study I realized that there was no single moment in
which records were appraised. Certainly, initial decisions were made to collect
some software instead of others. But the criteria used was constantly under
revision due to environmental concerns (storage, bandwidth, auditing concerns).
Also, the records that were acquired, the many computer files that comprise
software, were not as fixed as I initially thought, and were appraised again,
and again as files gave rise to other files as container file formats were
recognized and unpacked. The descriptions of the files, the RDS, which was the
purest expression of the archive, was itself changing over time, and sometimes
even its semantics (the fixity algorithms) were changed, which required
reprocessing again and again. Thus, appraisal, or the expression of a record's
value is not evaluated once at a particular phase in a life-cycle of a web
archive, instead it is spread across many archival processes, which repeat and
evolve.

The second given that I failed to fully register at the beginning of my project
was the ontology of web archives, or what constitutes a web archive. I started
out my project thinking I would study the places on the web that get called "web
archives", such as the Internet Archive. Web archives are commonly thought to be
specialized infrastructures that collect representations of web resources (web
pages), so that they can be "played back" later. Web archives may use different
software to achieve these ends, but to some degree they all crawl the web, save
WARC data, and index it, in order to play back what specific URLs looked like at
a particular time. In other words web archives attempt to recreate the
experience a person has when looking at a web page in their browser in a
particular moment.

My field study with NIST came together once I recognized that even though it did
not fit the usual architectural mold of a web archive, the NSRL was deciding to
collect things from the web, preserve them, and provide access to them, and
thus, it is a web archive (at least in part). The NSRL was not interested in
crawling the web in order to play back what web pages looked like at a given
time. Instead it was interested in presenting a machinic view into what software
is being made available on the web (the RDS). This realization opened my eyes to
the possibility that there are in fact many *shapes* of web archives to consider
in archival studies. Artificially limiting the study of web archives to one
specific technical shape significantly truncates the scope of phenomena we need
to be considering when we study and talk about web archives.

The third hidden axiom that I came to recognize during my research concerns the
concept of the archival record and its relation to appraisal value. Without
paying it much thought I assumed that appraisal value was a property, or
attribute of the record. Based on the research literature I thought archivists,
if they were lucky, would have an appraisal policy, collection development
policy, or at least some shared notion of what records the archive collected and
why. I thought that new records were evaluated using this criteria, and
a decision was  made to either accession or discard the records. I've already
discussed how I was mistaken about appraisal decisions happening in a singular
moment. However I was also mistaken about records having a specific value
as an attribute. The value of records acquired from the web by the NSRL were bound up in how the records were to be used. An essentialist view of appraisal, where value is a property of records, is replaced by a relational one, where records obtain value based on their use.

Initially this shift in attention to use seemed like a familiar pragmatist line
of argument about value, where the ends justify the means. But further
investigation, and reflection with @Ahmed:2019 revealed that some records were
acquired even though they had no obvious use (disuse). Some records were in a
superposition of use and misuse (ByLock and SWID). Use is fluid, multiple,
contradictory, and subject to resistance. Perhaps it is more accurate to say
that appraisal value is inherently tied to *practice* to avoid the utilitarian
interpretation of the word "use".

In principle this *use of use* and its application to archival appraisal is not
unlike the concept of functional analysis, which is at the core of appraisal
theories like macro-appraisal [@Cook:2004a] and documentation strategies
[@Samuels:1991]. Here is how Cook describes this shift from the record to
*function*:

> ... macro-appraisal shifts the initial and major focus of appraisal from the
> record--and any research characteristics or research values it may contain--to
> the functional context in which the record is created--its conceptual, virtual
> or functional provenance. Using knowledge gained by an institutional
> functional analysis, including an analysis of the interaction of function and
> structure, of organisational cultural dynamics, of record-keeping systems and
> of citizen/client involvement and interaction with the institution or

> implementing the key functions, programmes and transactions of the
> institution—would have had cause and the primary responsibility to create a
> document, what type of document would it be, and with whom would that
> corporate person interact in either its creation or its later operational use?
> These two questions suggest a third: which record creators or ‘functions’
> (rather than which records) are the most important? [@Cook:2004a, p. 9-10]

Cook acknowledges elsewhere that his definition of macro-appraisal (and its use
of functional analysis) relies heavily upon the citizen/state relation, but that
the principle should hold for relations that exist between company/customer,
university/student, hospital/patient, union/member, church/parishoner, etc. For
Cook the focus on the *functions* inherent in these relations helps to put the
question of records' value into the background. This move is especially
important in order to factor out any guesswork about potential research value.
However, notice how Cook positions the archivist on the outside looking in at
the functions, or as I have called them, uses? In my field study with NIST
participants were making appraisal decisions because they were in the process of
building an archive for use, these records had a particular function. Feminist
and STS scholar would call this an example of the *God Trick*:

> I would like to insist on the embodied nature of all vision and so reclaim the

> inscribes all the marked bodies, that makes the unmarked category claim the
> power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation.
> [@Haraway:1988, p. 581]. 

Cook and Samuels position the archivist as an analyst/judge one step removed
from the site of record creation. As evidenced in the NSRL-Stanford
collaboration to archive the Cabrinety collection, even when use isn't
completely understood, record creation is always an expression of
power/knowledge. If some story of use, disuse or misuse isn't visible something
is missing from the picture. At least Schellenberg owned that records are (in
part) collected for use by researchers [@Schellenberg:1956]. Research isn't the
only use for archival records, but it a significant one nonetheless. More
importantly *use* recognizes that records are created for particular purposes.
The value of records lies in an analysis of their genealogy of use, disuse,
misuse, and queer use. Where we can imagine queer use as unexpected value that
is discovered in research.

At the risk of naturalizing these genealogies of use, thereby erasing the role
of archival agency, one way to visualize these genealogies of use is as the
concentric rings of a tree trunk which spiral outwards, just as data is relayed
from one context to another [@Janee:2009].

Was the bark created to record the age of the tree, or to store information
about the amount of carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere, or to indicate how much
rainfall there was that year? No. The bark's initial use is to protect against
damage from parasites, animals, diseases, dehydration, and fire. As the tree
ages the bark supports the tree. Any secondary use of the bark over time, such
as to measure age, derives from an understanding of the bark's initial use.

While provenance is normally understood in terms of ownership, this genealogy of
use is at the heart of what provenance is concerned with. Below in Figure 25 is
a diagram of these concentric rings of use, where the initial use of the records
is labeled as `U<sub>0</sub>` and subsequent uses as `U<sub>n</sub>`,
`U<sub>n+1</sub>`.

![Concentric Rings of Use](images/use-rings.png){ height=45% }

Failing to attend to the use of records lets us believe in the fantasy of their
singular use, as if they are always and only the evidence of a particular
thing. But allowing use into the picture allows us to appreciate the full set of
contingent relations and value propositions that web archives participate in.
Perhaps it is easier to recognize these relations when considering digital
records, such as web archives, because as data they can easily copy and
transport themselves into new contexts. Figures 26 and 27 extend the single
series of use by illustrating how a series can be doubled where multiple uses
are present at one time: `U<sub>0</sub>` forks into `U<sub>1</sub>` and
`V<sub>1</sub>`. It is in these genealogies of use that we see the most complete
expression of the values that web archives entail. Archivists who divorce the
collection of records from the use of those records will be forever chasing
their own tail when trying to understand the value of records. Recognizing,
critiquing and celebrating the use of records is where we encounter the value of
web archives.

Dismantling these three hidden axioms (time, ontology and use) of appraisal in
web archives clears the way for several areas of values based research for web
archives and archival studies more generally. Archival studies researchers have
a much larger and more variegated landscape to observe and analyze once the
architecture of the web archive is freed from the notion that it must fit a
particular architectural shape, or technical mold. For example what archival
practices do individuals enact with their own social media data? How do the
"archives" offered by web platforms operationalize a view of what an archive is,
and how it should be used? By what processes are websites migrated forwards in
time as the contents of one content management system are migrated to another?
How do the archives of web content collected in one context transfer as assets
into another context during corporate acquisitions and mergers? How do
distributed web technologies such as IPFS [@IPFS:2020] or the partnership
between CloudFlare and the Internet Archive [@Graham:2020] enact a particular
archival view of the web? And as machine learning models are generated from
large accumulations of web content how do we adequately document these web
archives so that the biases inherent in the models can be interpreted? 

An example can help make this last question a bit more concrete. OpenAI's GPT-3
deep learning language model is trained using text collected from the web by the
CommonCrawl project [@Weinberg:2020]. What parts of the web are being collected
by CommonCrawl? How do we understand the values of these vast collections of
data and language models as web archives that are being created for particular
uses? Casting these research topics as questions for archival studies research
and not simply the concerns of machine learning or human computer interaction
(HCI) research is critical for understanding them not simply in terms of
innovation but as value driven efforts that extend over time.

But I think this dissertation's consideration of archival appraisal in the
context of web provides some insight into problems that have preoccupied
archival studies more generally. In a 2013 issue of the *American Archivist*
Mark Greene, Randall Jimerson and Michelle Caswell engaged in a heated debate
about the place of social justice in archival studies. To overly simplify a
complex set of arguments made by all three, Greene contended that a social
justice agenda in archives weakened the profession, because once activated, it
limits the archivist's ability to collect (e.g. from the opposing side of an
issue). Jimerson responded saying that he did not mean to suggest that all
archivists should assume the mantle of social justice, and that all archivists
needed to exercise their abilities and conscience--the world needs more than one
archives.  Caswell responded primarily to Greene by saying that an inadequate
engagement with what constitutes *social justice* by caricaturing a small number
of archival studies scholars undermined any argument he was attempting to make.
However, at the center of Greene's provocation was an interesting paradox, which
he presented by way of @Ketelaar:2005b, which has other parallels:

> The records created and used by German and Dutch agencies during the Second
> World War to account for the looting of Jewish assets continued to be used,
> after the war, by German and Dutch agencies in the processes of restitution
> and reparation. The same record was activated by different societal powers,
> for different purposes and for different audiences again and again, as it is
> today activated in the search for looted and lost works of art and other
> Holocaust assets. The looting and the registration of the looted property
> were, of course, an appalling event, but it was through the subsequent uses of
> the record that the primary registration became really a record of a traumatic
> experience. [@Ketelaar:2005b, p. 296].

How can archivists make appraisal decisions that reflect an alignment with
social justice? If a German archivist exercises their agency by distorting or
refusing to manage the records of looting then their subsequent use for
returning the stolen items to their rightful owners would not have been
possible. However, if they chose to create and manage these records to enable
the theft then they are a willing participant in an ethically bankrupt activity.
In some ways this is a case of 20/20 hindsight. But I think it's useful to
accept the paradox of these records as a philosophical problem.

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously saw paradoxes as linguistic
misunderstandings which dissolve with the therapy of philosophy.

> It is not our aim to refine or complete the system of rules for the use of our

Insights that allow problems to disappear rather than be solved are what
philosophy is all about. Later in life Wittgenstein proposed that words weren't
defined in terms of their reference to objects in the world, but in terms of
their use in human activity. Records are similar in that they have no value
outside of considerations of use. There may be many uses, some uses may be
hidden, some uses may conspire against each other, some uses may as yet be
unknown, but it's only in recognizing and understanding their use that a
record's value can be understood, and acted upon.
