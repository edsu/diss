# Acknowledgments

One of the difficulties of returning to university to pursue a PhD after
decades of working in the field is that there are too many people to thank.
I never thought I'd need so many people! Of course this dissertation would
never have come to fruition if it wasn't for the help I received from
my advisor Ricky Punzalan. Ricky encouraged me to read widely and deeply in the
archival studies literature, and to fully engage in the craft and practice of
writing. After having spent so much of my professional life as a software
developer focused on building tools, Ricky taught me the value of building
ideas, as tools for the mind. When Ricky moved back to the University of
Michigan we weren't able to continue our walk and talk meetings as we went in
search of coffee. But he chose to continue to support my work from afar when it
would have been much easier to focus on his new students and responsibilities.
I will always be thankful for that.

Also I want to thank the other members of my committee: Kari, Katrina, Matthew
and Wayne. You all were so generous with your time: listening to me and reading
drafts, sometimes at very difficult times in the semester, amidst the chaos
of the coronavirus pandemic. I am very lucky to have had you as first readers
of my work. I want to give special thanks to Kari for helping me shape my
research questions early on in my studies at Maryland. I also should thank
Matthew for the opportunity to teach alongside him in his digital studies
seminar, which gave me an real appreciation for how to meaningfully engage
students in conversation and scholarly debate.

I was very fortunate to have been a student of Jessica Vitak and Thurka
Sangaramoorthy whose qualitative and ethnographic methods classes proved to be
so important for my research project. The staff at the Maryland Institute for
Technology in the Humanities, especially Neil Fraistat, Trevor Mu√±oz and Grace
Babukiika, supported me by making time for me to pursue my research amidst
MITH's constant activity, while also providing me with an intellectually
welcoming and generative space to work. I must also thank NIST for inviting me
into the National Software Reference Library for my field study, and the many
practicing archivists, technologists and researchers that I spoke with in my
interviews.

Rather than pretend that this list is complete (it isn't) I'd like to
conclude by thanking a few close people who set me on my path, and helped me
along the way. Mom and Dad, I never wrote a proper thank you to you in my high
school graduation yearbook. I owe so much to you: your teamwork, your care for
life and memory, and your hope for the present and the future. I know that the
best parts of anything I've done have grown from the love you have given me.
Matthew, thank you for always reminding me of the importance of connecting with
others, and the value of a quick wit, sense of humor, and the gift of music,
when it is most needed. John, thank you for being my intellectual companion,
even as the years have separated us in space, I continue to draw on your
creative imagination and curiosity. Charlie, Graham and Maeve, thank you for
grounding me, for challenging me, and for showing me how to continue to grow as
a human being, and as your Dad. Kathy and Ron, thanks for your trust and
confidence, and showing me how to live a life for family. Finally, Kesa, none
of this would have gotten done if it wasn't for you. I know you know this
already. I don't say it hardly enough but your joyful light shines so brightly,
every day, and helps me see. Thank you for sharing your pragmatism with me: not
a cynical ends-justifies-the-means philosophy, but a centering wisdom and
concern for the present and the people in it, in all their complexities. Thanks
for being here, written between these lines.
