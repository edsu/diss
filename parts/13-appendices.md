# 8. Appendixes 

## A. Study 1 Documents

### A.1. Consent Form

You are invited to be in a research study that explores the selection of Web
content for preservation in an archive. You were selected as a possible
participant because you have some expertise in either the selection of Web
content for archival processing or the design of tools to assist in the
archiving of Web content. I hope to interview you on these subjects.

Interviewing will possibly occur with real-time computer and code referencing,
this is the considered the "observation" element of this study.  Please feel
free to ask me any questions before participating. Being in the study is
voluntary and you are free to stop at any time. Refusing to be in the study or
stopping study activity will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you
are otherwise entitled.

The purpose of this document is to give you the information you will need to
help you decide whether to be in the study or not.  Please read the form
carefully.  You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what I
would ask you to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a
volunteer, and anything else about the research or this form that is not clear. 
When I have answered all your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the
study or not.  This process is called "informed consent."  I will give you a
copy of this form for your records.

#### Background

This study is being conducted by Ed Summers in the College of Information
Studies at the University of Maryland. Its purpose is to explore the current
processes and tools used to select content from the Web for archiving. If you
agree to be in this study, I ask your permission to a conduct face to face
semi-structured interview.

Your decision on whether to participate will not affect your current or future
relations with the University of Maryland or your current employer, and you may
withdraw at any time without affecting those relationships.  The face to face
interview usually takes no more than 1 hour, and there is no compensation for
participating in the face to face interview. The observation component of this
study may be part of the interview and is included in this 1 hour time period.
I envision this as an active interview that possibly involves looking at Web
content together, talking about Web archiving work, and looking online for
examples to discuss.

The audio/video recordings will be transcribed and then coded to identify
patterns and strategies for selecting Web content for archiving.

#### Risks

There is no physical or medical component to this research, and there is no risk
of physical injury. The identities and organizational membership of the 
interviewees will not be revealed in our published findings, and a pseudonym 
will be used.

#### Benefits

There may be no benefits to you personally for participating in the current
research; however, there may be some professional and societal benefits. This
study will help the archival community better understand the processes by which
Web content is selected for an archive. Currently very little research into this
phase of the work of Web archiving has been done. The hope is that the findings
of this study will help influence the design of tools that assist archivists in
their work.

#### Confidentiality

Confidentiality will be maintained by a) aggregating information and b) by
assigning pseudonyms.  I have an ethical and legal obligation to protect
confidential information used or obtained in the course of research and all
policies on confidentiality apply equally to data stored both in the computer
and on paper records.  Any non-disclosure agreements to which you are a party
will be respected and maintained by the security of aggregation and pseudonyms.

Confidentiality will be maintained by aggregating information in tables and
graphs that describe broad trends in attitudes and demographics across the
population. Composite descriptive sketches will not refer to the data collected
from named individuals.
	
Confidentiality will be maintained by assigning you a pseudonym.  Any taped
conversations, paper notes, or other research materials associated with our
exchanges will be identified with the pseudonym.  The only code sheet
identifying you with your pseudonym will be kept in locked storage over a mile
away from the research materials. This code sheet will be destroyed at the end
of the study, or by the end of 2016.

If any published material is going to include a quotation from the transcript I
will notify you via email and request your approval. If I don't hear anything
back in two weeks I will resend the notification. If there is no response I will
publish the quotation. I will respect your wishes to either not include the 
quotation, or to provide clarification.

#### Contacts

You will be given a copy of this form to keep for your records, and you may ask
any questions you have now.  If you have questions later, you may contact me by
telephone at +1 (240) 478-7086 or by email at edsu@umd.edu.

### A.3. Interview Protocol

First, I want to thank you for participating in this interview today.  I know
you are busy and I really appreciate you taking the time to help me.  Before we
get started I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about the study and
what you can expect from this interview.

Just to review, the title of the study is Investigating Appraisal in Web
Archives. As you may know there are many initiatives to archive
parts of the Web. These can be found in libraries, archives, museums, 
businesses and government. Often these organizations have articulated collection
development policies to help guide what Web content is collected. However the 
actual process for discovering websites and content that is relevant for a Web
archive isn't well known. The Web is a big place, and even at the organizational
level it can be difficult to know what needs to be collected and when.

In this study I'd like to talk to you about this process of selection or
appraisal. The hope is that a better understanding of the decisions and 
mechanics of how archivists select content will help inform the design of 
new tools to assist archivists in their work. I'm really interested in the nitty
gritty practicalities about how websites are added to an archive. I do have a 
short list of questions but this is going is a semi-structured interview 
because I would like the conversation to evolve organically. I'm pretty sure 
I don't have all the right questions!

I'm anticipating that the interview will take anywhere from half an hour to an
hour. Feel free to say you don't know the answer to a questions, or you'd rather
not answer it, and you can end the interview at any time. Please ask me to
clarify any questions that aren't clear. I am recording the audio and video from
the interview, which I will be transcribing and then doing content analysis to
(hopefully) find patterns and themes. Your interview will be kept confidential
and destroyed at the completion of my study. I will not mention you or your
institution by name in my study except using a pseudonym. If I plan on quoting
you at all in published material I will modify the excerpt to reduce the
likelihood of identification. I will also contact you and ask for your
permission to use the segment.

Do you have any questions about what I just covered or anything else?

Great, well lets get started then.

1. Could you tell me a little bit about your role at XXX? (Alt: how long have you been there? What are your responsibilities?)

2. Can you describe your work environment? (Alt: How many people do you immediately work with, what are their roles?)

3. Have you ever selected Web content to be archived? (Alt: do you do this on a
regular basis?)

4. Try to recall a time when you selected content for archiving. What was it?
Can you remember how you found it?

5. Can you think of another example?

6. Can you think of any other examples that seem different from these two?

7. What criteria do you think go into deciding whether a particular Web page or website is worth collecting? Can you give me examples?

8. How does the presence of the content in other Web archives factor into your
decision if at all?

9. Do you consider whether it is important to collect the same web resource over time?

10. Do you record any information about why a particular website was selected?
Do you think that could be useful?

11. How does the perceived size of a website factor into your decision to archive content?

12. Do you search for content to archive? How do you do it?

13. Do you consult with your peers when locating Web content? How does that
work?

14. Do you talk to peers at other institutions or organizations when identifying
web content? 

15. Do you ever interact with the content owner/provider when selecting content
for archiving?

16. Do people ever try to donate Web content? Can you describe an example of
that?

17. Do researchers ever request that you archive particular Web content? How did
that happen?

18. Have there been any requests to access archived content yet by internal or
external people? How did that go?

18. Could an inventory of your Web archives contents be made available for a
follow up study?

19. Does your organization have a collection development policy when it comes to
collecting Web content? What kind of guidance does it provide? (Alt: are there any agreed on criteria for what Web content to archive?)

20. Is that policy available to the public? Can I get a copy?

#### Project Title

Enacting Appraisal: Investigating the sociotechnical factors of software selection in the NSRL.

#### Purpose of the Study

This research is being conducted by d Summers at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am inviting you to participate in this research project because you have worked to help build and/or sustain the National Software Reference Library.  The purpose of this research project is to better understand how decisions are made about how to build digital collections, particularly when they involve obtaining content from the web.

#### Procedures

The procedure involves an unstructured interview with you which will be audio recorded and transcribed.  Interviews will take between 60 and 90 minutes. If you wish you can choose a pseudonym that will be used in place of your name in all written materials.  Content analysis performed on the transcripts will be used to derive emergent themes and issues that speak to the study's research question. There are no direct benefits to participants.

#### Potential Risks

There is no more than minimal risk associated with participating in this study. However, every potential subject will have the option to refrain from participation.  Additionally, all participants will be asked if they would like me to use a pseudonym instead of their name in order to protect their identities and minimize risk.

#### Potential Benefits

There are no direct benefits to you. However, the goal of this study is to understand how content selection processes and technical infrastructures have coevolved in the NSRL. This may or may not be of interest to your work in or with the NSRL.

#### Confidentiality

Any potential loss of confidentiality will be minimized by storing data in encrypted form in a private DropBox folder which will only be accessible by researchers. If I write a report or article about this research project, your identity will be protected to the maximum extent possible. I will also notify you before hand if I plan to use any quotes from your interview to give you an opportunity to clarify, or if you would prefer me not to use the quote. 

Your information may be shared with representatives of the University of Maryland, College Park or governmental authorities if you or someone else is in danger or if we are required to do so by law. If participants wish their interviews can be donated back to the NSRL as historical documents.

#### Right to Withdraw

Your participation and Questions in this research is completely voluntary. You may choose not to take part at all. If you decide to participate in this research, you may stop participating at any time. If you decide not to participate in this study or if you stop participating at any time, you will not be penalized or lose any benefits to which you

### B.2. Recruitment Letter

Dear ___________

My name is Ed Summers, and I am a researcher from the College for Information
Studies at the University of Maryland. I am spending a year working with the
National Software Reference Library as part of NIST's Professional Research
Experience Program (PREP). During this time I'm investigating the social and
technical factors that help shape the construction of digital archives, in
particular the content that they collect.

Given that the NSRL is a unique and long running example of a digital archive I
was hoping to speak with you about your experience working in or with the NSRL.
Hearing more about the types of work you do, and how you think about the
activities of the NSRL would be extremely helpful to me as I conduct this
research project.

All interview materials (transcripts and recordings) will be kept confidential.
If you would rather not be named as a participant you can choose a pseudonym
that will be used in all research materials. In addition if any quotations from
the interview that are used in published materials they will be sent to you
beforehand for clarification and approval. I expect the interview to last no
longer than one hour. I hope we can find a time to talk.


Sincerely,

Ed Summers
