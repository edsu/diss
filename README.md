# Legibility Machines

Here's my completed dissertation in resplendent [PDF] and [EPUB] formats! Maybe
this is heresy, but I have updated pieces based on feedback I've received
post-defense, and when I've noticed typos. If you are a purist you can find the
originally accepted version over in [DRUM].

You probably won't want to do this, but for the build:

    sudo apt-get install pandoc texlive-latex-extra texlive-xetex

On Linux you'll need the Times New Roman font:

    sudo apt-get --reinstall install ttf-mscorefonts-installer

And then finally, at last:

    make
