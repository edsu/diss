I'm starting this file as a way to reflect on the writing process and mostly as
a place to jot down notes for ideas that come up during the writing process--so
that I stand a great chance of not forgetting them. We'll see how it goes I
guess...

I should make the connection between appraisal and bias in Machine Learning
somewhere in the intro.  The practices of appraisal shape the data that are
collected, and similarly will impact any kind of statistical analysis that is
done on the resulting data. I think pointing at Critical Data Studies here will
be important.

Move the discussion of governmentality to the beginning of the literature review
section to introduce the idea and foreshadow a discussion at the end.
