I'm starting this file as a way to reflect on the writing process and mostly as
a place to jot down notes for ideas that come up during the writing process--so
that I stand a great chance of not forgetting them. We'll see how it goes I
guess...

I should make the connection between appraisal and bias in Machine Learning
somewhere in the intro.  The practices of appraisal shape the data that are
collected, and similarly will impact any kind of statistical analysis that is
done on the resulting data. I think pointing at Critical Data Studies here will
be important.

Move the discussion of governmentality to the beginning of the literature review
section to introduce the idea and foreshadow a discussion at the end.

Thinking a bit about the ontology of the archival record. The artifact that is
being preserved in the NSDL is not a static given thing, but something that is
in transformation, by running the software and submitting it to various
extractions different layers of files are surfaced.  These files are like
objects being exposed by pulling back layers of sediment using various
archeological tools.  The existence of the archival record is in a state of
becoming, it is not a given but something that is discovered through processes
that are themselves points of contention.

It is somewhat difficult to see the connection between governmentality and the
work of the NSRL, mostly because the *government* aspect is starting me in the
face. It seems too obvious in a way. But it could be useful to think about how
the case of forensics, and fixity specifically, becomes an interest of digital
preservationists, as an aspect of governance in the NSDL context that is
internalized by professions and the profession. How do aspects of digital
curation, like fixity and file system identification, that are borrowed from the
digital forensics community get applied in digital preservation systems. This
reminds me quite a bit of how diplomatics are used in projects like the
InterPARES project have focused on authenticity.

I submitted the latest revision of the methods section to my committee to prep
for the proposal defense in two weeks. I need to develop some slides and
practice my talk.

I found this while reading some of my old notebooks, from June 27, 2019:

> Thinking about the NSRL's collecting as a way of *seeing* the web, a
> particular view of the contents of the web, in this case, software. It is
> different from how the Internet Archive sees the web as web pages. I think
> this waay of seeing is related to James Scott's Seeing Like a State, and also
> Vertesi's Seeing Like a Rover. 

Also, from the same time period:

> Seeing web archives in the case of the NSRL, and its attachment to fixity (a
> fixity on fixity, lol) provides a counterpoint or perspective from which the
> *seeing* of WARC based web archives can itself be "seen". How can we step out
> of what is meant by a "web archive" in order to bring it into focus?

At least I have a potential title for the chapter: THE FIXITY ON FIXITY.

My proposal for DH 2020 connects the DocNow work to the idea of ontological 
politics:

> Over the past four years the Documenting the Now project has been working to
> help build a community of practice around social media archiving that centers
> the ethical concerns of content creators, rather than simply the interests of
> cultural heritage organizations or social media platforms. Starting in the
> aftermath of the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri the project
> developed the Ferguson Principles to help guide memory workers who are
> interested in documenting activism and social movements.
>
> The Ferguson Principles have been put to work in a set of workshops with
> activist communities in the United States, in order to generate new knowledge
> practices for memory work in the age of social media. In addition the project
> has also been actively developing a portfolio of tools for data collection,
> publishing and analysis and using existing web archiving tools to help
> cultivate new approaches, and relationships between archivists, researchers
> and content creators.
>
> In this presentation we will highlight some of the challenges the project has

But, this orientation also draws from Escobar's political ontology ... and while
I've been thinking mostly about the context of DocNow it clearly and explicitly
applies in the NSRL case. The politics are so obvious and overemphasized it's 
almost redundant to mention it. But I think it's important to apply this
orientation in this case, particular when it comes to the multiple realities
presented by the NSRL: its use for identifying illegal material on the Internet,
and the collecting of games by games specialists.
